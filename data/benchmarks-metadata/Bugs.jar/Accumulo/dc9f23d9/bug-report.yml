BugID: ACCUMULO-776
Summary: TimestampFilter should serialize start and end as longs in the IteratorSetting
Description: "Although the TimestampFilter supports using longs to set the start or
  end timestamp, it formats them as strings using SimpleDateFormat when storing or
  retrieving them in the IteratorSetting.\n\nThis results in exceptions when the timestamps
  being used aren't able to be formatted as _yyyyMMddHHmmssz_. For example, try {{setEnd(253402300800001,true)}}\n\nInstead,
  {{setStart()}} and {{setEnd()}} could just as easily use {{String.valueOf(long i)}}
  to store the values, and {{init()}} could retrieve them using {{Long.valueOf(String
  s)}}.  "
