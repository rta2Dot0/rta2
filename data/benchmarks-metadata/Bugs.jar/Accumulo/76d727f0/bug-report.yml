BugID: ACCUMULO-209
Summary: RegExFilter does not properly regex when using multi-byte characters
Description: "The current RegExFilter class uses a ByteArrayBackedCharSequence to
  set the data to match against. The ByteArrayBackedCharSequence contains a line of
  code that prevents the matcher from properly matching multi-byte characters.\n\nLine
  49 of ByteArrayBackedCharSequence.java is:\nreturn (char) (0xff & data[offset +
  index]);                                                                                              \n\nThis
  incorrectly casts a single byte from the byte array to a char, which is 2 bytes
  in Java. This prevents the RegExFilter from properly performing Regular Expressions
  on multi-byte character encoded values.\n\nA patch for the RegExFilter.java file
  has been created and will be submitted."
