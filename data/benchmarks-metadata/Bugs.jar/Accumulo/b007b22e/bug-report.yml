BugID: ACCUMULO-151
Summary: Combiner default behavior is dangerous
Description: "Currently if the users does not give the combiner any columns to work
  against, it will work against all columns.  This is dangerous, if a user accidentally
  forgets to specify columns then their data could be unintentionally corrupted.  Something
  different needs to be done.  \n\nAlso classes that extend combiner should call super.validateOptions(). "
