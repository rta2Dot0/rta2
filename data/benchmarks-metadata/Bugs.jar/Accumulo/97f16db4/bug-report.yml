BugID: ACCUMULO-3383
Summary: AccumuloVFSClassloader creates conflicting local cache directory names when
  vfs.cache.dir property is set.
Description: "When the vfs.cache.dir property is not set, the AccumuloVFSClassloader
  will use java.io.tmpdir as a base directory for the local cache of jars and then
  generate a unique directory name using a combination of the processid, hostname
  and userid executing the JVM.\n\nWhen the vfs.cache.dir property is set, that value
  is used as the base directory and  an attempt to generate a unique directory is
  made using an AtomicInteger. This isn't suitable because for non-long lived processes,
  this will always be 1 - and there's a good chance that directory already exists
  and is owned by another user, and not writable to by the user in question. \n\nThis
  leads to a failure of the invoked accumulo component to start.\n\nModify the behavior
  of the unique directory creation when vfs.cache.dir is set so that it employs the
  same mechanism for unique directory naming that is used when it is not set.\n"
