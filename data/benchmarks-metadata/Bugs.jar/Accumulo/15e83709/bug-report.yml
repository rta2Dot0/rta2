BugID: ACCUMULO-3242
Summary: Consolidate ZK code WRT retries
Description: |-
  A couple of general ZK things that should be fixed up:

  # Multiple means of automatic retrying of recoverable ZooKeeper errors through use of an InvocationHandler and a Proxy around IZooReader(Writer)
  # Encapsulate retry logic
  # Switch over callers to use the retrying instance instead of the non-retrying instance
