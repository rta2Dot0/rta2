BugID: ACCUMULO-3897
Summary: ShutdownTServer never sets requestedShutdown
Description: |-
  ACCUMULO-1259 made ShutdownTServer a bit more sane WRT to what it was doing and the FATE repo interface.

  One attempt it makes it to not repeatedly invoke shutdownTServer on the master..

  Except {{requestedShutdown}} is never set to {{true}}.
