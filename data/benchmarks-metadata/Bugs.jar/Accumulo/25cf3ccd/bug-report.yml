BugID: ACCUMULO-1051
Summary: Authorizations has inconsistent serialization
Description: |-
  The same set of authorizations may not serialize to the same value each time, if specified in a different order when constructed (like new Authorizations("a", "b") and new Authorizations("b", "a")), because serialization reproducibility depends on the insert order in the underlying HashSet.

  So, one could get the following to happen:
  {code:java}
  true == auths1.equals(auths2) && !auths1.serialize().equals(auths2.serialize());
  {code}
