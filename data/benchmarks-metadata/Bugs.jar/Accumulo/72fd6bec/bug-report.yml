BugID: ACCUMULO-3150
Summary: MiniAccumuloConfig doesn't set 0 for monitor log4j port
Description: MonitorLoggingIT will fail on a host if the monitor is already running
  because MAC doesn't configure itself to use an ephemeral port. We haven't really
  noticed this because MAC doesn't start a monitor by default.
