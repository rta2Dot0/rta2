BugID: ACCUMULO-3475
Summary: Shell.config()'s return value is ignored.
Description: "{{Shell.config()}} returns a boolean which is true if there was an error
  configuring the shell, but the value is never observed. This can result in other
  unintended errors (like trying to use the ConsoleReader member when it's not initialized)."
