BugID: ACCUMULO-3218
Summary: ZooKeeperInstance only uses first ZooKeeper in list of quorum
Description: |-
  Had tests running which had a quorum of 3 ZooKeeper servers. One appears to have died and the test was then unable to connect to the Accumulo shell, hanging on trying to connect to ZooKeeper.

  There was no client.conf file present, so a ClientConfiguration was constructed from accumulo-site.xml.

  {code}
  this.zooKeepers = clientConf.get(ClientProperty.INSTANCE_ZK_HOST);
  {code}

  When the commons configuration AbstractConfiguration class is used with the get() method, only the first element in the value is returned, as the implementation treats the other items as a list because of the default separator of a comma.

  It's easily reproduced with the following:

  {code}
      ZooKeeperInstance inst = new ZooKeeperInstance("accumulo", "localhost,127.0.0.1");
      System.out.println(inst.getZooKeepers());
  {code}

  The above will print

  {noformat}
  localhost
  {noformat}

  instead of the expected

  {noformat}
  localhost,127.0.0.1
  {noformat}
