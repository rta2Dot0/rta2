BugID: ACCUMULO-2487
Summary: Value implementation provides conflicting statements
Description: |-
  The javadoc for the no-arg constructor for {{Value}} states that it "Creates a zero-size sequence." However, the implementation of get will error in this case.
  {code}
  public byte[] get() {
      if (this.value == null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Uninitialized. Null constructor " + "called w/o accompanying readFields invocation");
      }
  {code}

  Either we need to change the javadoc to be more explicit or change the behaviour of various accessors in the class. I would consider both solutions to be breaking of the API contract since we are changing what clients can expect from us.
