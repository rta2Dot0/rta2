BugID: ACCUMULO-2671
Summary: BlockedOutputStream can hit a StackOverflowError
Description: "This issue mostly came up after a resolution to ACCUMULO-2668 that allows
  a byte[] to be passed directly to the underlying stream from the NoFlushOutputStream.\n\nThe
  problem appears to be due to the BlockedOutputStream.write(byte[], int, int) implementation
  that recursively writes out blocks/buffers out. When the stream is passed a large
  mutation (128MB was sufficient to trigger the error for me), this will cause a StackOverflowError.
  \n\nThis is appears to be specifically with encryption at rest turned on.\n\nA simple
  fix would be to unroll the recursion."
