BugID: ACCUMULO-1986
Summary: Validity checks missing for readFields and Thrift deserialization
Description: Classes in o.a.a.core.data (and potentially elsewhere) that support construction
  from a Thrift object and/or population from a {{DataInput}} (via a {{readFields()}}
  method) often lack data validity checks that the classes' constructors enforce.
  The missing checks make it possible for an attacker to create invalid objects by
  manipulating the bytes being read. The situation is analogous to the need to check
  objects deserialized from their Java serialized form within the {{readObject()}}
  method.
