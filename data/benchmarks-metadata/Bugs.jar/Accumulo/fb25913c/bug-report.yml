BugID: ACCUMULO-1514
Summary: AccumuloVFSClassloader incorrectly treats folders as folders of jar files
Description: |
  Specifying a directory of classes is incorrectly interpreted as a directory of jars in the general.dynamic.classpaths configuration property.

  Example: adding a path such as *_$ACCUMULO_HOME/core/target/classes_* gets incorrectly interpreted as *_$ACCUMULO_HOME/core/target/classes/\*_* and evaluates to *_$ACCUMULO_HOME/core/target/classes/org_* and *_$ACCUMULO_HOME/core/target/classes/META-INF_*, but *NOT* to *_$ACCUMULO_HOME/core/target/classes_* as expected.
