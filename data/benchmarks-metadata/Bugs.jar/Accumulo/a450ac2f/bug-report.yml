BugID: ACCUMULO-821
Summary: MockBatchScanner inappropriately filters on ranges
Description: I believe I have a legitimate case where an iterator will return something
  outside of the seeked-to range.  This appears to work in a live system, but fails
  to work in test cases using the MockBatchScanner.  I believe this is because the
  MockBatchScanner filters on the supplied ranges in addition to seeking the iterators
  to each range.  Either we need to remove this range filter, or fix the real system
  to do the same thing.  I prefer the former of course.
