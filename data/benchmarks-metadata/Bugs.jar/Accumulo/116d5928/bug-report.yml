BugID: ACCUMULO-414
Summary: Make sure iterators handle deletion entries properly
Description: In minor compaction scope and in non-full major compaction scopes the
  iterator may see deletion entries. These entries should be preserved by all iterators
  except ones that are strictly scan-time iterators that will never be configured
  for the minc or majc scopes. Deletion entries are only removed during full major
  compactions.
