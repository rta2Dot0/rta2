BugID: ACCUMULO-844
Summary: VisibilityFilter does not catch BadArgumentException
Description: If an invalid column visibility makes it into the system, then the VisibilityFilter
  may not handle it properly.   The accept method handles VisibilityParseException,
  but some of the parse code throws a BadArgumentException which is not handled.
