BugID: ACCUMULO-1348
Summary: Accumulo Shell does not respect 'exit' when executing file
Description: |-
  If there is an {{exit}} statement in the file given via {{accumulo shell -f file}}, the execution seems to skip it and go on to the next command instead of terminating.

  To recreate:
  {noformat}
  [mike@home ~] cat bug.accumulo
  exit
  scan -np -t !METADATA
  [mike@home ~] bin/accumulo shell -f /home/mike/bug.accumulo
  {noformat}

  Expected output: None
  Actual output: A full scan of the !METADATA
