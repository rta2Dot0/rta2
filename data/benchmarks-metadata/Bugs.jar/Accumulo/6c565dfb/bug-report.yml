Summary: Shell's setiter is not informative when using a bad class name
Description: In the shell, I did setiter using a class that wasn't found. Rather then
  a message about it not being found, I just get told that I have an invalid argument.
  Even turning on debug, I had to use the stack trace to figure out why it was erroring.
