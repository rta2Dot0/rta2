BugID: ACCUMULO-3634
Summary: AuthenticationTokenSecretManager might delete key while ZooAuthenticationKeyWatcher
  enumerates existing keys
Description: |-
  Noticed the following race condition.

  The secret manager (in the master) on startup will enumerate the old keys used for creating delegation tokens and delete the keys that are expired.

  At the same time, the watcher (in each tserver) might see some updates to these keys and update the secret manager. There's a race condition there that the watcher might try to read a key that the secret manager just deleted.

  Need to catch the NoNodeException in the watcher and just accept that it's ok if one of these children are deleted to avoid a scary error in the monitor.
