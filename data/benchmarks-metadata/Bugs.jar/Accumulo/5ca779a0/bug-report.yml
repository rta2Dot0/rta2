BugID: ACCUMULO-4029
Summary: hashCode for Mutation has an unfortunate implementation
Description: |
  While looking at how a tablet server processes constraint violations, I happened to look into Mutation's hashCode implementation:

  {code}
    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
      return toThrift(false).hashCode();
    }
  {code}

  Clicking through to TMutation hashCode finds this gem:

  {code}
    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
      return 0;
    }
  {code}
