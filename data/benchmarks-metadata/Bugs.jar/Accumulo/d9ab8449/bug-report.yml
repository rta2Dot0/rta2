BugID: ACCUMULO-1312
Summary: Don't cache credentials in client-side Connector
Description: |
  AuthenticationToken objects are Destroyable. However, this cannot be exercised properly in the client code, because the Connector immediately serializes the credentials and stores them as long as the Connector lives.

  It should be possible to destroy a token after creating a Connector, and thereby forcing any further RPC calls initiated by that Connector to fail to authenticate. This means that serialization on the client side to a TCredentials object needs to occur just before the RPC call.
