BugID: ACCUMULO-2899
Summary: WAL handling fails to deal with 1.4 -> 1.5 -> 1.6
Description: |-
  After doing a 1.4 -> 1.5 -> 1.6 upgrade that still has WALs for some tables, the 1.6 instance fails to correctly handle the 1.4 recovered WALs.

  This can happen either through not waiting long enough after the upgrade to 1.5 or because of an offline table brought online on 1.6 (ala ACCUMULO-2816).
