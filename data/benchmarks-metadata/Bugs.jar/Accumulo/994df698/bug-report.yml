BugID: ACCUMULO-1505
Summary: MockTable's addMutation does not check for empty mutation
Description: "When calling addMutation or addMutations on a MockBatchWriter, the updates
  stored in the mutation are iterated over then committed in the MockTable class.
  \n\nWhen this occurs in the TabletServerBatchWriter (eventually called from the
  BatchWriterImpl), however, the mutation size is first checked and if the mutation
  size is 0, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.\n\nIn practice, if you have code
  that tries to submit an empty mutation to a BatchWriter, it will fail and throw
  an exception in the real world, but this will not be caught in tests against MockAccumulo."
