BugID: ACCUMULO-1730
Summary: ColumnVisibility parse tree nodes do not have correct location offsets for
  AND and OR nodes
Description: |-
  Trying to do some transformations on visibility strings and running into issues working with the parse tree:

  Clojure 1.5.1
  user=> (import [org.apache.accumulo.core.security ColumnVisibility])
  org.apache.accumulo.core.security.ColumnVisibility
  user=> (def vis (ColumnVisibility. "(W)|(U|V)"))
  #'user/vis
  user=> (.getTermStart (first (.getChildren (.getParseTree vis))))
  1
  user=> (.getTermEnd (first (.getChildren (.getParseTree vis))))
  2
  user=> (.getTermStart (second (.getChildren (.getParseTree vis))))
  0
  user=> (.getTermEnd (second (.getChildren (.getParseTree vis))))
  8

  Shouldn't those last two be 5 and 8?
