BugID: ACCUMULO-193
Summary: key.followingKey(PartialKey.ROW_COLFAM_COLQUAL_COLVIS) can produce a key
  with an invalid COLVIS
Description: Need a new algorithm for calculating the next biggest column visibility,
  because tagging \0 to the end creates an invalid column visibility. We might be
  able to minimize the timestamp for this (i.e. set timestamp to Long.MIN_VALUE, but
  keep column and row elements the same).
