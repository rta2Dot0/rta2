BugID: WICKET-4659
Summary: The default exception mapper is replying cacheable exceptional responses
Description: The problem is that some common URLs in the application like to a page
  instance are responding the cached exception page rather than hitting the server
  for the page instance being requested. It happens because at some moment in the
  past a exception page were replied and cached for a request in this URL.
