BugID: WICKET-5237
Summary: Wicket generates invalid HTML by expanding col tags
Description: |-
  hi,

  I just noticed that wicket expands col tags, even though the (x)html specifications forbids it.

  take this markup as an example:

  <table>
      <colgroup>
          <col width="20%" />
          <col width="80%" />
      </colgroup>
      <tbody>
          <tr>
              <td>I take a fifth of the available space</td>
              <td>I take four fifth of the available space</td>
          </tr>
      </tbody>
  </table>

  Instead of return this as-is, it get's converted to:

  <table>
      <colgroup>
          <col width="20%"></col>
          <col width="80%"></col>
      </colgroup>
      <tbody>
          <tr>
              <td>I take a fifth of the available space</td>
              <td>I take four fifth of the available space</td>
          </tr>
      </tbody>
  </table>

  But the specifications mention that col tags must not have end tags. This may be related to WICKET-2765, as this seems to be the point when col was added to the OpenCloseTagExpander class. Note that it is ok to have a non closing col tag in html (self-closing in xhtml). It's all about generating a separated end tag.

  This happens in wicket 6.8, but I guess it's relevant to all versions down to wicket 1.4.

  Specs for reference:
