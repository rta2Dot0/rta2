Summary: FileUpload writeToTempFile() method throws NPE for sessionless requests
Description: "I have created stateless page with stateless form containing FileUploadField,
  however when I tried to post file to it, NPE was thrown.\n\nThe issue is caused
  by method FileUpload#writeToTempFile() method trying to use session id as temp file
  prefix. \n\nWorkaround: create temp file manually and use method FileUpload#writeToFile(
  myTempFile)"
