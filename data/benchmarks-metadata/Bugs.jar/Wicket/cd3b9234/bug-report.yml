BugID: WICKET-5883
Summary: Feedback messages not cleared for invisible/disabled form components on submit.
Description: "Having: \n- IFeedbackMessageFilter.NONE used as the default application's
  feedback message cleanup filter (in order to make feedback messages not to disappear
  after page refresh, i.e. persistent)\n- form with validatable component whose enabled/visible
  state may be dynamically changed by user (e.g. checkbox \"send me email\" and text
  field \"email\")\n\nFirst, user tries to submit form having invalid value - as the
  result validation error occurs. \nThen user makes that component invisible and retries
  form submitting - as the result no validation errors, but form wasn't submitted.\n\nThis
  happens because that component still has error feedback message got from first submit.
  Note that when using default application's feedback message cleanup filter, form
  is successfully submitted.\n\nProbably, feedback messages should be cleared for
  invisible/disabled form components on submit, as it done for visible/enabled components
  in FormComponent.validate()"
