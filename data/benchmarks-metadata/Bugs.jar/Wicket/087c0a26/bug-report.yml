BugID: WICKET-5701
Summary: 'WebSocketRequestHandler is not set as a scheduled and thus RequestCycle#find(AjaxRequestTarget.class)
  doesn''t work '
Description: |-
  As discussed at https://groups.google.com/d/topic/wicket-jquery-ui/fw6TdyO5o18/discussion AbstractWebSocketProcessor doesn't schedules the WebSocketRequestHandler in the request cycle and thus it is not reachable for user code via RequestCycle#find(Class) API.

  Additionally the configured application RequestCycle listeners are not notified.
