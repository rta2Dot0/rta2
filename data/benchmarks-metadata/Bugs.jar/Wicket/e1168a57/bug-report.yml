BugID: WICKET-3713
Summary: g/apache/wicket/protocol/http/request/UserAgent matches method is not correct
Description: |-
  In the UserAgent Enum matches method, the loop over detectionStrings is at most executed once:

      for (List<String> detectionGroup : detectionStrings)
      {
        for (String detectionString : detectionGroup)
        {
          if (!userAgent.contains(detectionString))
          {
            return false;
          }
        }

        return true;
      }

  It returns true after only processing the first element in the detectionStrings list.
  It never looks at any of the other elements of the list.
