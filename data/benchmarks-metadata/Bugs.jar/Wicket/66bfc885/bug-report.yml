BugID: WICKET-4816
Summary: Handling of semicolons in form action URLs
Description: |-
  What I expect to happen when there is no semicolon support in Wicket is that a
  URL in a form like below stays intact and will not be cut off at the position of
  the first semicolon:

  <form action="http://localhost:8080/dor/abc_1234:56;023:456_def_78;90.html"
  method="post"><input type="submit" value="Submit" /></form>

  In my application the part abc_1234:56;023:456_def_78;90.html is "named1" in the
  mapping below:

  mount(new MountedMapper("dor/#{named1}", TestPage.class, new
  MyPageParametersEncoder()));

  and parsed in MyPageParametersEncoder.

  The officially intended use of semicolons in URLs seems to be specified in "RFC
  1808 - Relative Uniform Resource Locators, 2.4.5."
  (http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1808.html). But that´s not what I´m looking for.

  If I had not some pages running on this syntax, I could easily swap the
  semicolon with another symbol. Nevertheless and if I´m correctly informed, I
  think those URLs should not be cut off.

  (Quotation from the mailing list)

  The quickstart can be tested with the following URLs:

  http://localhost:8080/dor/abc_1234:56;023:456_def_78;90.html
  http://localhost:8080/dor/abc_1234:56%3B023:456_def_78%3B90.html
  http://localhost:8080/dor/?abc=1234:56%3B023:456&def=78%3B90

  The crucial part is the action attribute in the form in the page´s source code, which contains i.e. "./abc_1234:56?-1.IFormSubmitListener-form".
