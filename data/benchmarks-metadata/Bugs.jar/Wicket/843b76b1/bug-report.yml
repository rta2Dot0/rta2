BugID: WICKET-3836
Summary: regression on strategy to integrate cas authentication
Description: |
  yes, It happens in org.apache.wicket.request.handler.PageProvider.getPageInstance() ,
  but not for the WelcomePage, but the redirection page (RedirectPage).
  the CASPageAuthorizationStrategy as we are not authentified a org.apache.wicket.RestartResponseAtInterceptPageException with in parameter an instance of RedirectPage.
  On the second call of PageProvider.getPageInstance, the pageId is of 0, an all other parameters are nulls.

  The run seems quite different on 1.5-RC4.2 version - There is only one call of the method PageProvider.getPageInstance() and it come after the CASPageAuthorizationStrategy.isPageAuthorized
