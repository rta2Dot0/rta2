BugID: WICKET-5980
Summary: When using Servlet 3.0 filter Wicket calculates filter path wrong
Description: |
  When using a servlet 3.0 filter with annotations Wicket calculates the filter path wrong causing it to not match any pages other than the home page.

  e.g.

  {code}
  @WebFilter(value = "/web/*", initParams = {@WebInitParam(name = "applicationClassName", value = "com.example.CheesrApplication")})
  public class CheesrFilter extends WicketFilter {
  }
  {code}

  Will cause Wicket to create a filter path of /web/*/ instead of the expected /web.
