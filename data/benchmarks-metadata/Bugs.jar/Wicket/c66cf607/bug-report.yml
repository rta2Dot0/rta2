BugID: WICKET-4578
Summary: Link always causes Page to become stateful, regardless of visibility
Description: "Despite the changes made in WICKET-4468 , an invisible Link still causes
  a Page to become stateful. \n\nThe problem seems to be that Component#isStateless
  does this before even checking the visibility: \n\n\t\tif (!getStatelessHint())\n\t\t{\n\t\t\treturn
  false;\n\t\t}\n\n\n... and Link#getStatelessHint() just contains just \"return false\"
  . "
