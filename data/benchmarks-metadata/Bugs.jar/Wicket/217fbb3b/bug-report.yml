BugID: WICKET-5082
Summary: Ajax update renders parent/child JS in different order than initial Page
  render
Description: |-
  See attached quickstart.  On initial page load, the child Javascripts are rendered and executed first, followed by the parent's JS - in this case a Datatables.net JS. Everything works fine.

  However, if you click on a link in the DefaultDataTable, we trigger a DDT refresh via Ajax, and then you can see that the parent's JS is executed first, before the child JS - this causes a problem since the parent JS modifies the visible rows in the table and Wicket can no longer find some of the child rows.

  I expected the order of JS contributions to be the same for initial page render and any Ajax updates.
