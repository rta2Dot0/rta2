BugID: WICKET-3620
Summary: IResponseFilter cannot change buffer contents
Description: Changes to the responseBuffer, passed to an IResponseFilter, are not
  picked up, nor are newly created AppendingStringBuffer (return value of the method).
  Both callers of the method invoke it with a copy of the buffer and ignore return
  values (BufferedWebResponse line 145 and AjaxRequestTarget line 687).
