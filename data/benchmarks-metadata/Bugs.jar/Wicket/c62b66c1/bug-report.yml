BugID: WICKET-3563
Summary: Interaction betwen IAjaxRegionMarkupIdProvider, renderPlaceholderTag and
  visibility
Description: "I've just discovered what I think is a bug with\nIAjaxRegionMarkupIdProvider.
  We are using it on a Behavior that provides\na border to form components (label,
  mandatory marker, etc), which for\nthe most part works great.\n\nWe have encountered
  a problem when toggling the visibility of a form\ncomponent with this behavior via
  ajax. \n\nThe component is first sent out visible and the markup is all correct.\n\nA
  change elsewhere on the page causes the component to be set to not\nvisible and
  redrawn via ajax. The ajax response contains a tag with a\nmarkupid generated via
  renderPlaceholderTag. This does not take into\naccount the  IAjaxRegionMarkupIdProvider
  behaviour.\n\nAnother change happens on the page causing the component to become\nvisible,
  and the ajax replace can't happen because the component with\nthe correct markupId
  is not present.\n"
