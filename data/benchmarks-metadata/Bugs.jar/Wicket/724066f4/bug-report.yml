BugID: WICKET-5497
Summary: NPE in JsonUtils when the value is null
Description: |-
  Most part of org.apache.wicket.ajax.json.JsonUtils.asArray(Map<String, Object> map) is trying carefully avoid null value. But there is following line

  else if (value.getClass().isArray())

  which cause NPE in case of empty value for some key.


  P.S. Will provide patch.
