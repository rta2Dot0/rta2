BugID: WICKET-5441
Summary: IResourceCachingStrategy implementations should only set caching if version
  matches
Description: Implementations of IResourceCachingStrategy (FilenameWithVersionResourceCachingStrategy
  and QueryStringWithVersionResourceCachingStrategy) should only set cache duration
  to maximum if the version matches. Currently, if a user requests a resource with
  an arbitrary version, the version will be cached for one year (WebResponse.MAX_CACHE_DURATION).
  So people could polute proxy caches with potentially upcoming version.
