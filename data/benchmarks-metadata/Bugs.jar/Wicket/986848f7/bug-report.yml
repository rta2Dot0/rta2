BugID: WICKET-1931
Summary: FormTester doesn't correctly submit a form when a FileUploadField was not
  set (which is not required)
Description: |-
  FormTester doesn't correctly submit a form when  a FileUploadField was not set.
  This file is not required.

  So it is impossible to create a real test because I am forced to always set a File to check to whole form.

  There was discussion about this problem here: http://www.nabble.com/FormTester-and-FileUploadField-td18566869.html


  I will be very grateful if you can fix it :)
