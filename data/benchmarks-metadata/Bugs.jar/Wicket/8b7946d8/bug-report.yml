Summary: CachingResourceLocator lookup key doesn't take strict into account
Description: "CachingResourceLocator uses a CacheKey to store lookups for resources.
  \n\nWith e.g. \n- b_nl.js\n- b.js\n\nWhen e.g. a strict resource lookup for b.js
  with locale \"us\" is performed, it will store the not-found for locale \"us\" under
  the cache key. The cache key consists of resource name, locale, style and variation.
  However when you search non-strict for locale \"us\", the resource locator should
  find the non-localized resource \"b.js\", but since a matching key for the lookup
  was stored for this particular resource, it will fail.\n"
