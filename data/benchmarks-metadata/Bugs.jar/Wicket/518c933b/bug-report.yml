BugID: WICKET-5114
Summary: Url#toString(StringMode.FULL) throws exception if a segment contains two
  dots
Description: |+
  When invoking toString(StringMode.FULL) for a URL like
  /mountPoint/whatever.../
  an IllegalStateException is thrown with message: Cannot render this url in FULL mode because it has a `..` segment: /mountPoint/whatever.../

  The method does not actually check for `..` segments but rather checks whether path.contains("..")
