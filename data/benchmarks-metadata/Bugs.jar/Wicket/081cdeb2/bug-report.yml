BugID: WICKET-4020
Summary: ResourceMapper throws IllegalStateException when attempting to map a request
  to a URL ending in a empty segment (directory)
Description: "ResourceMapper.mapRequest() calls ResourceMapper.removeCachingDecoration()
  which, throws IllegalStateException if the URL's last segment is an empty string.\n\nURLs
  like: path/to/my/non/wicket/directory/ end in a empty segment. \n\nWe must change
  the behaviour to not attempt to undecorate a URL ending in an empty segment."
