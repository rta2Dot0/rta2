BugID: WICKET-5486
Summary: WebPageRenderer should honor RedirectPolicy.ALWAYS_REDIRECT more consistently
Description: "In WebPageRenderer shouldPreserveClientUrl() currently has precedence
  over RedirectPolicy.ALWAYS_REDIRECT.\n\nThis can lead to confusion or unexpected
  behavior when RedirectPolicy.ALWAYS_REDIRECT is explicitely set, but for some reason
  shouldPreserveClientUrl() returns true and thus no redirect is performed due to
  the logic in WebPageRenderer.\n\nA fix for this particular problem could be implemented
  in \nWebPageRenderer as of Wicket 6.12.0 by changing line 211 to:\n\n                ||
  (shouldPreserveClientUrl && getRedirectPolicy() != RedirectPolicy.ALWAYS_REDIRECT))
  //\n\n\nNote that this problem is slightly related to WICKET-5484. Both fixes combined
  the line could look like this:\n\n                || (shouldPreserveClientUrl &&
  !isAjax && getRedirectPolicy() != RedirectPolicy.ALWAYS_REDIRECT)) //\n\n"
