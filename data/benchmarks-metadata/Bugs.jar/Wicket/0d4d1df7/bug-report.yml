Summary: Session should be bound when adding messages to it
Description: |-
  When using the Sessions info(), error() and success() methods, and the session is temporary, the messages can be dropped silently. This happens when on stateless pages and a redirect happens in the same request during which a session message is added.

  The fix for this could be to make sure the session is bound and call Session#bind() automatically when a session message is added.
