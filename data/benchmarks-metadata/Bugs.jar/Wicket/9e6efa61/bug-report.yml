BugID: WICKET-5204
Summary: The DateTimeField.onBeforeRender() method does not format the fields correctly.
Description: The current implementation relies on the org.joda.time.MutableDateTime
  instance to format the date, hours, amOrPm, and minutes fields. Unfortunately, the
  MutableDateTime constructor is not provided with the client's TimeZone value (assuming
  it is set). As a result, the joda library uses the JVM's default timezone. If the
  defaul timezone differs from the client's timezone, the formatted fields may turn
  out to be incorrect.
