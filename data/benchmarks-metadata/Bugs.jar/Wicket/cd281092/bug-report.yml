BugID: WICKET-2350
Summary: Localization messages stops working with validators since 1.4-rc2
Description: |-
  With the previous 1.3.6 and 1.4-rc1 releases I was capable to restrict a localization message for a validation to only one wicket id e.g. :

  in foobar.java
  RequiredTextField nameTF = new RequiredTextField("name");
  nameTF.add(StringValidator.lengthBetween(2, 255));
  nameTF.add(new PatternValidator("[^|:]*"));

  and in foobar.properties
  name.Required=some text
  name.StringValidator.range=some other text
  name.PatternValidator=some other text again

  So, like this I could have to create an another RequiredTextField named "password", and attach to it a different localization message (for example "password.Required=blabla").

  But somehow with the 1.4-rc2-5 it looks like that this function is broken, it only recognizes the localization text, when I remove the "name." prefix from my property.
