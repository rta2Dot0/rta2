BugID: WICKET-5966
Summary: ResourceUtils.getLocaleFromFilename can't handle minimized resources well
Description: |-
  I think the ResourceUtils.getLocaleFromFilename(String path) has the order of locale and minimization wrong:
  It currently parses: File.min_Lang_Coun_Var.ext while the typical convention is File_Lang_Coun_Var.min.ext
  Surely considering the ResourceUtils.getMinifiedName() method which does work according to convention.
