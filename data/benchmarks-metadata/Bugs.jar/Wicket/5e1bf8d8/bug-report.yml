BugID: WICKET-4594
Summary: Do not use the parsed PageParameters when re-creating an expired page
Description: |-
  WICKET-4014 and WICKET-4290 provided functionality to re-create an expired page if there is a mount path in the current request's url.
  There is a minor problem with that because the page parameters are passed to the freshly created page. I.e. parameters for a callback behavior are now set as page construction parameters.
  Since the execution of the behavior is ignored for the recreated page these parameters should be ignored too.
