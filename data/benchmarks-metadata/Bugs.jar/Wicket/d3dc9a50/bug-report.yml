Summary: UrlUtils.isRelative returns false if URL parameter contains an absolute URL
Description: "I have a page that gets a return path for a back link as a parameter.
  A link to this page looks like this:\n\n./mypage?return=http://example.com\n\nIn
  WebRequestCodingStrategy.encode, this URL is returned by pathForTarget.\nThen it
  is checked whether this URL is relative using UrlUtils.isRelative. The URL is apparently
  relative, but UrlUtils.isRelative returns false, since the check contains:\n\n(url.indexOf(\"://\")
  < 0\n\nthis is false for the above example. Thus, an incorrect path is returned
  by WebRequestCodingStrategy.encode (relative path resolution does not take place).\n\nA
  fix for the problem would be to check for \n\n!(url.startsWith(\"http://\") || url.startsWith(\"https://\"))\n\nOr,
  if other protocols should also be supported, a regular expression like \"^[^/?]*://\"
  should work. \n"
