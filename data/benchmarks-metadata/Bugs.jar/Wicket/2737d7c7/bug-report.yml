BugID: WICKET-4153
Summary: The tbody section of a DataTable is empty when no records are returned by
  the provider.
Description: |-
  When a DataTable is rendered without records, the tbody section is empty. This violates the html spec.

  From the spec:
  "When present, each THEAD, TFOOT, and TBODY contains a row group. Each row group must contain at least one row, defined by the TR element."
  and
  "The THEAD, TFOOT, and TBODY sections must contain the same number of columns."
