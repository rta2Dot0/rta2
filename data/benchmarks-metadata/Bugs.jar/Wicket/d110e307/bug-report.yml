BugID: WICKET-5102
Summary: 'wicket-bean-validation: Bean validation PropertyValidator only works with
  direct field access'
Description: |-
  There's a substring indexing bug in the wicket-bean-validation module in org.apache.wicket.bean.validation.DefaultPropertyResolver that causes it to only work with direct field access and fail when field is missing and getter method should be used.

  The problem is on this line:

      String name = getter.getName().substring(3, 1).toLowerCase() + getter.getName().substring(4);

  Which should be:

      String name = getter.getName().substring(3, 4).toLowerCase() + getter.getName().substring(4);

  (or simply a single character access)
