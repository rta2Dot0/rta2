BugID: WICKET-4932
Summary: Mounted page is not throwing ExpireException with setting setRecreateMountedPagesAfterExpiry(false)
Description: "We have a page that is both bookmarkable (and accessible with certain
  page parameters) and has a second constructor taking an object. \nWhen ever the
  session time-out we want to show a session expired page. But we get a exception
  because Wicket is trying to rebuild the page with no page parameters. \nWe have
  set the setting getPageSettings().setRecreateMountedPagesAfterExpiry(false); This
  works when clicking on (ajax)links, but it's not working when using the back/forward
  button in the browser (or javascript:history.go(-1)).\n\nI'll attache a quickstart."
