BugID: WICKET-5484
Summary: WebPageRenderer must not render full page in Ajax requests
Description: |-
  WebPageRenderer renders the full page when WebRequest#shouldPreserveClientUrl() is true or RedirectStrategy.NEVER_REDIRECT is configured.

  For Ajax request this means that wicket-ajax-js will not be able to parse the HTML response.
