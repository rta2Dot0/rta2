BugID: WICKET-5522
Summary: Failing HTTPS redirect to RequireHttps annotated pages with ONE_PASS_RENDER
  strategy
Description: |-
  Activated JS: Start the quickstart -> Press the submit buttons -> See the secured page with https!

  Deactivates JS: (NoScript Firefox Plugin): Start the quickstart -> Press the submit buttons -> See the secured page BUT with HTTP!

  There was no proper https redirect.

  If I change the rendering strategy to REDIRECT_TO_BUFFER everything works fine, but if I change the strategy to ONE_PASS_RENDER the https forwarding does't work anymore. But only if I deactivate all scripts...

  Regards,
  Dmitriy
