BugID: WICKET-5085
Summary: InlineEnclosure are piling up on each render
Description: "InlineEnclosureHandler#resolve() uses an auto-incremented id for its
  resolved InlineEnclosure, \n\nOn the next render, a new instance will be resolved,
  since the id of the already resolved InlineEnclosure does not match the id in the
  markup.\n\nBut InlineEnclosures are not removed after render as other auto-components,
  thus all instances pile up in the owning container of the markup.\n"
