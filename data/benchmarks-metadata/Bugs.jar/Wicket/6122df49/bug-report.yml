BugID: WICKET-5250
Summary: Minified css/js gets compressed
Description: "Given an application with a resource reference to a minified script,
  i.e. html5.js and html5.min.js.\n\nWhen the ResourceRequestHandler responds \nit
  will set compress to false, if the resource reference was PackageResourceReference\nbut
  it will not change compression if the resource reference was JavaScriptResourceReference.\n\n\nPackageResourceReference
  handles minified resources more or less correctly (if they are minified, they should
  not be further compressed), but this behavior is overwritten in its subclasses.\n"
