Summary: Bounds error in PageableListView#getCurrentPage()
Description: |-
  In the getCurrentPage() method of class PageableListView, the following code:

  while ((currentPage * rowsPerPage) > getList().size())
  {
             currentPage--;
  }

  checks if "first cell if out of range". However, the index of that first cell is (currentPage * rowsPerPage), and then the comparison with getList().size() should use a ">=" instead a ">".
