BugID: WICKET-5783
Summary: Multiple events in AjaxEventBehavior with prefix 'on'
Description: "if multiple events are used and one starts with \"on\", it only works
  if it is the first one, because of:\n\n{code}\n\t\tif (event.startsWith(\"on\"))\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tevent
  = event.substring(2);\n\t\t}\n{code}\n\nWhy are events possible to start with \"on\"
  ? \n\nIs this legacy? Perhaps should be removed for Wicket 7 ?\n"
