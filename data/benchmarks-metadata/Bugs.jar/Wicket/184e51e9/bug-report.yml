BugID: WICKET-5147
Summary: WicketTester MockHttpRequest.getCookies very slow / OutOfMemory
Description: "\nWe have an extensive set of WicketTester tests. Recently, the wicket
  RELEASE in the maven repository changed to 6.7.0. After the new version, our tests
  got very slow.\n\nWhen profiling, I discovered that the MockHttpRequest.getCookies()
  was taking up a lot of time. Also, tests failed because of OutOfMemory exceptions.
  My guess is that somehow a lot of objects are created at such speeds that the GC
  cannot clean them\n\nI will investigate further, but switching back to 6.6.0 solved
  the issue. \n\n[Edit]\nThe tests are run with TestNG and using 'mvn test'"
