BugID: WICKET-3845
Summary: support custom response headers in AbstractResource.ResourceResponse
Description: |
  I'm converting an application to Wicket 1.5 and I see some problems with resources.

  There is a case I need to add headers (not present in ResourceResponse properties) and it looks ugly.

  This is what I need to do:

      @Override
      protected void configureCache(ResourceResponse data, Attributes attributes)
      {
          super.configureCache(data, attributes);
          ((WebResponse) attributes.getResponse()).setHeader("Accept-Ranges", "bytes");
      }

  It's a hack to use configureCache here, but this can't be added to setResponseHeaders, which seams a better apparent method name for it.
