BugID: WICKET-5138
Summary: Wicket does not correctly handle http OPTIONS requests
Description: |-
  currently these requests cause regular processing (page rendering), when in fact they should have a special response.

  rendering the page in OPTIONS causes renderCount to be incremented and this messes with the subsequent request to the same url via a GET or POST
