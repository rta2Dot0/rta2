Summary: Minified name resolves incorrectly if default resource reference is used
Description: "In PackageResourceReference.\n\nWhen a default reference to a minified
  resource is used (i.e. the resource wasn't mounted) the resource reference name
  includes '.min'. \n\nWhen trying to resolve the minified name, another '.min' is
  appended, resulting in the minified name resolving to 'html5.min.min.js'. \n\nAs
  a result, the PackageResourceReference concludes that the resource was not minified,
  and adds compression."
