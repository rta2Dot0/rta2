BugID: WICKET-3514
Summary: SimpleTree example not working with CryptoMapper
Description: "Adding the following lines to WicketExampleApplication.java causes the
  SimpleTree example to break. There are no expand icons anymore and there is no way
  to expand the tree. Even the expand link will not work.\n\nAdd to WicketExampleApplication.java
  \n\nIRequestMapper cryptoMapper = new CryptoMapper(getRootRequestMapper(), this);\nsetRootRequestMapper(cryptoMapper);\n\n\nComment
  out in WicketExampleApplication.java \n\n//getSecuritySettings().setCryptFactory(new
  ClassCryptFactory(NoCrypt.class, ISecuritySettings.DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY));\n\nWithout
  the CryptoMapper everythings works fine.\n\n\n"
