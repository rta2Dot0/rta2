BugID: WICKET-5572
Summary: Dequeueing problem when there is TransparentWebMarkupContainer around <wicket:child/>
Description: |-
  While testing 7.0.0-M1 release I've found an issue with wicket-bootstrap's sample application.

  Here is a minified version of it that reproduces the problem.
  The two important things are:
  - a TransparentWebMarkupContainer (TWMC) is attached to <html> tag in the base page
  - the sub page is requested

  It appears that dequeueing logic cannot find the closing tag of the TWMC and thinks that </wicket:child> is the closing tag.
