BugID: WICKET-5071
Summary: 404 Error on Nested ModalWindows in IE7 and IE8
Description: |-
  When opening a ModalWindow inside a ModalWindow, the inner ModalWindow generates a 404 error.  Both windows use a PageCreator for content.

  To replicate, you must use an actual IE 7 or IE 8 browser, as this does not replicate using developer tools and setting the document and brower to IE 7.

  The problem can be seen at http://www.wicket-library.com/wicket-examples/ajax/modal-window.  I will attach a Quickstart as well.
