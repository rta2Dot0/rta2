Summary: MountMapper does not support correctly parameter placeholders
Description: "Package mounting doesn't support parameter placeholders. The problem
  seems to be inside MountMapper which should wrap PackageMapper and take care of
  substituting placeholders with their actual value. \nMore precisely this class doesn't
  read parameter values from PageParameters and it's not very clear to me how it tries
  to read these values.\nDoes anybody have some hints about this class?"
