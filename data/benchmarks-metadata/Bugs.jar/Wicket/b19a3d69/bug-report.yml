BugID: WICKET-4610
Summary: WicketTester.assertRedirectUrl always fails because it always thinks the
  redirect was null
Description: |
  I have a page which always redirects.

  When I write a test for this page, tester.assertRedirectUrl(...) always fails with the assertion failure showing that the redirect URL was null.

  The page does redirect when running the application for real and I have stepped through in the debugger when running the test and it goes all the way to the HttpServletResponse.sendRedirect call.

  However, in the same debugging session, tester.getLastResponse().getRedirectLocation() == null

  Cut-down example follows.


  public class AlwaysRedirectPage extends WebPage
  {
      public AlwaysRedirectPage()
      {
          // redirects to another web server on the same computer
          throw new RedirectToUrlException("http://localhost:4333/");
      }
  }

  public class TestAlwaysRedirectPage
  {
      @Test
      public void test()
      {
          WicketTester tester = new WicketTester();
          tester.startPage(AlwaysRedirectPage.class);
          tester.assertRedirectUrl("http://localhost:4333/");
      }
  }
