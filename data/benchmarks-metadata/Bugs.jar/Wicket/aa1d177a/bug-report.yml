BugID: WICKET-3603
Summary: DataTable row groups are present in markup even when they contain no rows.
Description: |-
  As per the HTML spec :
  "When present, each THEAD, TFOOT, and TBODY contains a row group. Each row group must contain at least one row, defined by the TR element."

  There is no check in place to remove the row group tags from the output if they don't contain any row.
