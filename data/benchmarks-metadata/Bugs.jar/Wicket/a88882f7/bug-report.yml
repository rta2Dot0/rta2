BugID: WICKET-4518
Summary: Wicket example 'forminput' is broken due to bad url for IOnChangeListener
Description: "http://localhost:8080/forminput (wicket-examples) doesn't change the
  locale of the labels when the locale select is changed.\nThe reason seems to be
  the produced url: './.?5-1.IOnChangeListener-inputForm-localeSelect' \nThis is parsed
  to a Url with one empty segment and thus HomePageMapper doesn't match it and doesn't
  handle it."
