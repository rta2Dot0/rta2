BugID: WICKET-5094
Summary: ISecuritySettings#getEnforceMounts(true) prevents access to *all* non-mounted
  bookmarkable pages
Description: |-
  ISecuritySettings#setEnforceMounts(true) is meant to be used to prevent access to mounted-pages via BookmarkableMapper, e.g. when Page1.class is mounted:

     http://localhost:8080/niceurl/a/nice/path/to/the/first/page

  ... then the following url will not be accepted:

     http://localhost:8080/niceurl/wicket/bookmarkable/org.apache.wicket.examples.niceurl.Page1

  But starting with Wicket 1.5.x access to *all* non-mounted pages via BookmarkableMapper is prevented, i.e. no url "http://localhost:8080/niceurl/wicket/bookmarkable/*" is matched.
