Summary: Rescheduling the same ajax timer behavior causes memory leak in the browser
Description: 'AbstractAjaxTimerBehavior uses JavaScript setTimeout() function to do
  its job. It has a #stop() method that clears the timeout but if the timeout is re-scheduled
  without being cleared a memory leak is observed in the browser.'
