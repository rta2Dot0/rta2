BugID: WICKET-3769
Summary: WicketSessionFilter and HttpSessionStore use different attribute name for
  Wicket Session
Description: "from this topic \nhttp://apache-wicket.1842946.n4.nabble.com/WicketSessionFilter-and-ignorePaths-in-WicketFilter-td3570291.html\nPlease,
  look at the second post (the ignorePaths param is not linked with this issue as
  the title suggests).\n\nHow to reproduce with the quickstart:\n1. open localhost:8080
  - a wicket test page is displayed.\n2. open localhost:8080/external - this is the
  external servlet that tries to access the wicket session. An exception is thrown."
