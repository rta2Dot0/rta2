BugID: WICKET-3196
Summary: UrlValidator failes to validate urls that containt multiple dots in path
Description: |+
  refer to UrlValidator.java:466 (isValidPath).
  if we have an url, that contains more than two consequent dots, for example "http://www.somedomain.com/this_one_is_tricky...but...still.....valid", validator will fail.
  btw, the other side effect is that countTokens actually counts '...' a two 2dots.
  One possible workaround is not just count '..' tokens, but count them along with slash, like '../'.
