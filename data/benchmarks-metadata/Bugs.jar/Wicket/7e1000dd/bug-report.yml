BugID: WICKET-128
Summary: Debug settings / serialize session attributes option not working
Description: |-
  Session attributes are serialized even if this debug setting is turned off. I've noticed that the code that serializes attributes and logs their serialized size in HttpSessionStore#setAttribute is duplicated in Session#setAttribute - but without the debug settings condition. This code was added by the recent patch resolving WICKET-100 and only in the trunk, not in the wicket-1.x branch... why???
