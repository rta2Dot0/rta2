BugID: WICKET-3644
Summary: RequestCycleListenerCollection.onException should not throw an exception
  when multiple listeners handle the exception
Description: When multiple listeners handle the exception, RequestCycleListenerCollection
  should simple take the first handler. The current approach makes it impossible to
  add a listener that handles all exceptions and later add listeners for specific
  exceptions. Simply removing the 'if (handlers.size() > 1)' should suffice.
