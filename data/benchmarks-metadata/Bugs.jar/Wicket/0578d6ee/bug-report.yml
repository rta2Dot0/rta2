Summary: Invalid javascript when setStripJavascriptCommentsAndWhitespace is enabled
Description: |-
  When setStripJavascriptCommentsAndWhitespace is enabled (for example in deployment mode), some javascript files get corrupted. For example, the following line (notice the 2 spaces after 'return')
  return  this.__unbind__(type, fn);
  is compacted to
  return
  this.__unbind__(type, fn);
  which does not execute the unbind function.
