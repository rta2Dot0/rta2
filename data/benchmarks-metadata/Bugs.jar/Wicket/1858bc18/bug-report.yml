BugID: WICKET-3721
Summary: The Url's query parameters are not properly URL encoded
Description: |-
  If page parameter has a value with special characters like ' then it is rendered as it is in the produced markup and is only XML encoded but never URL encoded.
  This causes broken html for example in the case when a Link is attached to a non- a|area|link tag:


  <html><body><span wicket:id="link" onclick="var win = this.ownerDocument.defaultView || this.ownerDocument.parentWindow; if (win == window) { window.location.href=&#039;bookmarkable/org.apache.wicket.MockPageWithLink?urlEscapeNeeded=someone&#039;s+ba+parameter&#039;; } ;return false"></span></body></html>

  Notice that &#039; after 'someone' closes the location.href string too early and breaks the app.
