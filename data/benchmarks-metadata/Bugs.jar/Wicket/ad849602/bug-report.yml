BugID: WICKET-4824
Summary: Redirect to HTTPS is using wrong port 80 if HttpsConfig with default ports
  80/443 is used
Description: |-
  HttpsMapper#mapHandler() doesn't set the Url's port, if the desired protocol uses the standard port.

  This leads to UrlRenderer choosing to the request's port as fallback (which is 80 before switching to https).
