BugID: WICKET-5686
Summary: "@Inject should require the bean dependency instead of setting null"
Description: |-
  When using {{@SpringBean}}, if the bean cannot be injected then Wicket will throw {{Exception}}.

  However current behavior if when using {{@Inject}} inside component, the field will be left as null. This is inconsistent behavior with what CDI spec and how the "real" Spring does it.

  Wicket should change its behavior so that {{@Inject}} is always required. If the dependency is optional the user can use {{@SpringBean(required=false)}} as always.
