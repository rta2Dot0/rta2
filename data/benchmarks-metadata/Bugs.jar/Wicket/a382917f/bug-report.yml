Summary: TimeOfDay.valueOf(Calendar, Time) and TimeOfDay.valueOf(Time) incorrectly
  use 12-hour clock
Description: |-
  TimeOfDay.valueOf(Calendar, Time) is implemented as:
      return militaryTime(time.getHour(calendar), time.getMinute(calendar), time.getSecond(calendar));

  This is flawed because Time.getHour() is implemented as:
      return get(calendar, Calendar.HOUR);
  and Calendar.HOUR is for the 12-hour clock. The result is that TimeOfDay.valueOf(Calendar, Time) incorrectly only returns 12-hour results, not 24-hour results. This affects TimeOfDay.valueOf(Time) as well since it is implemented in terms of the previously-named method.

  One fix would be to change Time.getHour() to use Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY. Since Time doesn't have an am/pm indicator this seems reasonable. An alternate, more localized fix would be to change TimeOfDay.valueOf(Calendar, Time) to call time.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) to get the hour value.
