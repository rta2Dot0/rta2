BugID: WICKET-4738
Summary: DownloadLink doesn't wrap the String model used for file name nor does it
  detach
Description: "Component DownloadLink doesn't call method wrap of class Component on
  parameter fileNameModel. This causes models like StringResourceModel to not resolve
  resource bundles correctly.\nSee the discussion here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12196533/how-to-use-wicket-stringresourcemodel-in-downloadlink\n\nThe
  patch seems quite trivial. \n\nDetachment is also missing."
