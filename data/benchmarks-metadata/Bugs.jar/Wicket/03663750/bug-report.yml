BugID: WICKET-5960
Summary: Page header isn't rendered for pages where URL has changed during render
Description: "Due to the changes in WICKET-5309, a page is re-rendered when any of
  the URL segments is modified during the request:\n\nFrom WebPageRenderer.java:\n\n{code}\n\t//
  the url might have changed after page has been rendered (e.g. the\n\t// stateless
  flag might have changed because stateful components\n\t// were added)\n\tfinal Url
  afterRenderUrl = requestCycle\n\t\t.mapUrlFor(getRenderPageRequestHandler());\n\n\tif
  (beforeRenderUrl.getSegments().equals(afterRenderUrl.getSegments()) == false)\n\t{\n\t\t//
  the amount of segments is different - generated relative URLs\n\t\t// will not work,
  we need to rerender the page. This can happen\n\t\t// with IRequestHandlers that
  produce different URLs with\n\t\t// different amount of segments for stateless and
  stateful pages\n\t\tresponse = renderPage(afterRenderUrl, requestCycle);\n\t}\n\n\tif
  (currentUrl.equals(afterRenderUrl))\n{code}\n\nThe re-render causes the <head> section
  to be empty because it was already rendered in the first try."
