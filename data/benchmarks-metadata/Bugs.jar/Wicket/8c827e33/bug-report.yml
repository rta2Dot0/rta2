BugID: WICKET-4927
Summary: Header can not be set from IRequestCycleListener#onEndRequest()
Description: |-
  Due to HeaderBufferingWebResponse a header can no longer be set from IRequestCycleListener#onEndRequest().

  In 1.4.x this was possible because BufferedWebResponse just passed through all headers to HttpServletResponse.
