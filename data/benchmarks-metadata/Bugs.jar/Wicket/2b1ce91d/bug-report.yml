BugID: WICKET-5043
Summary: Page not mounted with WebApplication#mountPackage
Description: |-
  A bookmarkable page FormPage is mounted via WebApplication#mountPackage().

  If this page is opened via IModel model; setResponsePage(new FormPage(IModel model)); then the URL is /wicket/page?0 which is not mounted.

  If the page is mounted via WebApplication#mountPage() then the URL is mounted as expected.

  If the page is not mounted then the users get PageExpiredException which in this case is unrecoverable.
