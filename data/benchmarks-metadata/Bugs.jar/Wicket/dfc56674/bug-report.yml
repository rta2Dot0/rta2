BugID: WICKET-4572
Summary: 'DiskDataStore returns the wrong page when the page disk space is full '
Description: |-
  If the configured file size for the session data is overflowed (see org.apache.wicket.settings.IStoreSettings#setMaxSizePerSession(Bytes)) then Wicket may return wrong page data (bytes) for a expired page.

  The problem is in org.apache.wicket.pageStore.PageWindowManager#idToWindowIndex which may have several page ids (the keys) pointing to the same window index (values).
