BugID: WICKET-5916
Summary: StackOverflowError when calling getObject() from load() in LDM
Description: The fix for WICKET-5772 caused an infinite loop when calling getObject()
  from inside load() in LoadableDetachableModel. While of course unwise to do so and
  nobody in their right mind would do so directly, such a cycle can be triggered through
  a series of unrelated calls emanating from load().
