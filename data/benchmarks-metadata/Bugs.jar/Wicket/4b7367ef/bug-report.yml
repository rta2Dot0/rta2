BugID: WICKET-5131
Summary: Problems with cookies disabled when using 301/302 and also 303 (even with
  cookies)
Description: "As mentioned in the mailing list by Martin, i open this as a bug...\n\nIts
  not possible to use 303 as redirect (SC_SEE_OTHER) because thats not supported,
  only 302 and 301 are supported but this is defined in RFC HTTP 1.1 from 1997. \n\n301
  will add the Location header - which works as expected when disabling cookies. But
  a 302 (which is what i prefer) will redirect to the same page because the Location
  header is missing. When i enable cookies, its working.\n\nExample can be found here:
