BugID: WICKET-3719
Summary: Component's markup cannot be found in Ajax requests if the parent is transparent
Description: "When TransparentWebMarkupContainer is used an inner markup container
  cannot find its markup on Ajax updates.\nThe problem seems to be caused by the fact
  that ComponentResolvers#resolve() is not executed and since there is transparent
  container involved Markup.find(String) cannot find the markup for non-transparent
  markup containers.\nI'll commit a disabled test case that shows the problem. "
