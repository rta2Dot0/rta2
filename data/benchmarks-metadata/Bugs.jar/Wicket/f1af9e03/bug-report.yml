BugID: WICKET-5546
Summary: Adding behavior in component instantiation listener causes Page.onInitialize()
  being called even if constructor throws an exception
Description: "Page.onInitialize() will be called even if constructor throws an exception\nin
  case below code is added in wicket WebApplication.init():\ngetComponentInstantiationListeners().add(new
  IComponentInstantiationListener() {\n              @Override\n              public
  void onInstantiation(Component component) {\n                  component.add(new
  Behavior() {\n\n                  });\n              }\n             \n          });\n\nIt
  seems that the instantiation listener adds the behavior to the page at very start
  of the page constructor, and then the page is marked as dirty to cause onInitialize()
  being called afterwards."
