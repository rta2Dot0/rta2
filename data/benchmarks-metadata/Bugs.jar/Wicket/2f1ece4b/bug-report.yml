BugID: WICKET-4760
Summary: JavaScriptStripper fails with single line comments
Description: |-
  The valid input
  x++ //
  x++

  gets transformed to
  x++ x++

  which is syntactically invalid. This breaks the unminified version of bootstrap 2.1.1.

  The problem doesn't occur with multiline comments because the linebreaks are preserved there.
