BugID: WICKET-4030
Summary: HeaderResponse.renderCSSReference does not render context path relative url,
  but wicket filter url-pattern relative url
Description: In an application with a wicket filter url-pattern different than /*,
  if you use HeaderResponse.renderCSSReference(String url), where url is a context-path-relative
  url (css/main.css, for example), the generated css link is not context relative,
  but wicket url-pattern relative.
