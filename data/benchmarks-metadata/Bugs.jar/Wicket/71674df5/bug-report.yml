BugID: WICKET-5734
Summary: Problem with WICKET-4441 and RestartResponseAtInterceptPageException
Description: WICKET-4441 introduced an issue when our app has an authorization strategy
  and user is logged out. If user tries to access a protected url/page, RestartResponseAtInterceptPageException
  is handled by DefaultExceptionMapper and leads to exception page instead of redirecting
  user.
