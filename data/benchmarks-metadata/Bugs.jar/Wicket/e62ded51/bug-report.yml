BugID: WICKET-4519
Summary: discrepancy between JavaDoc and code in MarkupContainer#visitChildren()
Description: |-
  The JavaDoc for  MarkupContainer#visitChildren() states that
   "@param clazz The class of child to visit, or null to visit all children"

  The parameter clazz is used to create a new ClassVisitFilter which in
  its visitObject() does not check for clazz == null, leading to a NPE.
