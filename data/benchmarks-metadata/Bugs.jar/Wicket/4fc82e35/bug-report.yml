BugID: WICKET-4715
Summary: WebApplication doesn't recognize if an incoming request is multipart.
Description: "Thanks to the mail at http://apache-wicket.1842946.n4.nabble.com/Read-POST-based-request-from-external-site-td4651269.html
  we have spotted a problem with method  newWebRequest of class WebApplication. \nIt
  seems that this method doesn't test if the original request is multipart and doing
  so post parameters go lost. \nWe should create a  MultipartServletWebRequestImpl
  when such a type of request is being served. I attach a possible patch but I'm not
  100% about two things:\n- which is the best way to determinate if a HttpServletRequest
  is multipart?\n- in order to build a MultipartServletWebRequestImpl we need to provide
  a string identifier for the upload.   How can we generate it (in my patch it's a
  constant value)?\n"
