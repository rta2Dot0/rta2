BugID: WICKET-3931
Summary: Component markup caching inconsistencies
Description: "In WICKET-3891 we found that Component#markup field is not being reset
  between requests. The problem is that this field is transient and it is null-ified
  only when the page is read from the second level page cache (see https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/qIaoAQ).
  If the page instance is read from first level cache (http session) then its non-serialized
  version is used and the markup field value is still non-null.\n\nIn WICKET-3891
  this looked like a minor issue with the markup caching in development mode but actually
  this problem is valid even in production mode.\nSee the attached application. When
  the panel's variation is changed every MarkupContainer inside still uses its old
  markup. "
