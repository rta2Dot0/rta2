BugID: WICKET-5711
Summary: OnChangeAjaxBehavior should listen for both 'inputchange' and 'change' events
  for TextField and TextArea
Description: |-
  WICKET-5603 introduced a regression that a TextField using OnChangeAjaxBehavior doesn't work anymore when used as date picker, or Select2.
  The problem is that usually extensions like DatePicker and Select2 will fire 'change' event when they update the text input.

  OnChangeAjaxBehavior should use both 'inputchange" and "change" events for TextField and TextArea components.
