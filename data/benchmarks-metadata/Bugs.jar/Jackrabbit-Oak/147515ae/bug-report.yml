BugID: OAK-3020
Summary: Async Update fails after IllegalArgumentException
Description: |-
  The async index update can fail due to a mismatch between an index definition and the actual content. If that is the case, it seems that it can no longer make any progress. Instead it re-indexes the latest changes over and over again until it hits the problematic property.

  Stacktrace attached.
