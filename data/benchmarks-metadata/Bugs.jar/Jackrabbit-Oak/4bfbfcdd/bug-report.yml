Summary: ContentMirrorStoreStrategy should utilize path restriction when available
Description: |-
  Currently {{ContentStoreMirrorStrategy}} has a mirror of content path under {{:index}}. Yet, while {{query}} (and {{count}}) methods doesn't jump directly into restricted path.

  This would be very useful for {{PropertyIndex}} where the queries can be optimized by supplying a path restriction along with an indexed property restriction (I don't know if queries with references would use paths so much though)
