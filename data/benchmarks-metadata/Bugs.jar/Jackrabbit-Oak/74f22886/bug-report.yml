BugID: OAK-2355
Summary: TarMK Cold Standby expose standby read timeout value
Description: |+
  Running into a read timeout on the standby instance logs some uncaught error:
  {code}
  org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.plugins.segment.standby.client.SegmentLoaderHandler Exception caught, closing channel.
  io.netty.handler.timeout.ReadTimeoutException: null
  {code}

  I'm not sure how/if I need to fix this, the sync process will pickup again, but we can expose the timeout value, so if the network connection is known to be poor, a client can increase the timeout to work around this issue.
