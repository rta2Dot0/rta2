BugID: OAK-208
Summary: RootImplFuzzIT test failures
Description: |-
  As seen in the CI build, {{RootImplFuzzIT}} fails every now and then. This might be because of OAK-174, but there's been quite a bit of other work on the same area, so this could be caused also by something else.

  The troublesome seeds as seen in failing CI builds are 1437930918, 206057576, 1638075186, 1705736349, -1856261793 and 569172885.
