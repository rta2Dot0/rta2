BugID: OAK-395
Summary: Inconsistency in Node#setProperty in case of null value
Description: "Setting a null value to a single valued property will result\nin 'null'
  being returned while executing the same on a multivalued\nproperty will return the
  removed property.\n\njr2 returned the removed property in both cases as far as i
  \nremember and i would suggest that we don't change that behavior. in\nparticular
  since the specification IMO doesn't allow to return\nnull-values for these methods."
