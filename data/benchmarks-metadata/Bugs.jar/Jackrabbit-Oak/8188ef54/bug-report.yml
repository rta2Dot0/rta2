BugID: OAK-1739
Summary: Incorrect handling of multivalued comparisons in queries
Description: |-
  [Section 6.7.14|http://www.day.com/specs/jcr/2.0/6_Query.html#6.7.16 Comparison] of the JCR 2.0 spec says:

  bq. ... operand1 may evaluate to an array of values (for example, the values of a multi-valued property), in which case the comparison is separately performed for each element of the array, and the Comparison constraint is satisfied as a whole if the comparison against any element of the array is satisfied.

  This is currently not the case in Oak. Instead only the first value of the array is used in the comparison.
