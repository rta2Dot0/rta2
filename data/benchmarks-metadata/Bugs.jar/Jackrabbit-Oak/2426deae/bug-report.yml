Summary: Async index update persists conflict markers
Description: "A long running test I performed yesterday failed with a FileNotFoundException
  in the lucene index. After analyzing the issue it turned  out the async index update
  persisted a conflict markers introduced by a rebase call. So far I'm not able to
  reproduce it with a more simple test setup and after a shorter time (the initial
  test failed after 10 hours). Given the way the async index update work, there shouldn't
  be any conflicts, because it's the only component writing into this location of
  the repository. \n\nAs an immediate workaround, I'd like to add the AnnotatingConflictHandler
  & ConflictValidator combo to the merge call to make sure a commit with conflict
  markers does not get persisted."
