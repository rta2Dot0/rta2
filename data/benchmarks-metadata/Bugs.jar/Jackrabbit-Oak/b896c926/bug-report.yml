BugID: OAK-509
Summary: Item names starting with '{X}' cause RepositoryException
Description: |-
  The exception is RepositoryException: Invalid name or path: {0} foo

  E.g. for an item named '{0} foo'.

  I guess oak-jcr tries to interpret it as a name in expanded form but does not find a namespace uri for '0'. IIRC these names are valid in Jackrabbit 2.x.
