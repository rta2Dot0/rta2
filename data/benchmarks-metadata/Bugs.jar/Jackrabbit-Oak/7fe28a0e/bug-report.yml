Summary: Trying to remove a missing property throws PathNotFoundException
Description: |-
  The following code snippet throws a {{PathNotFoundException}} if the "missing" property is not present.

  {code:java}
  node.setProperty("missing", (String) null);
  {code}

  A better way to handle such a case would be for the above statement to simply do nothing.
