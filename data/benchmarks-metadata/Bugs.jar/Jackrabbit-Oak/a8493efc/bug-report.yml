Summary: The Property2Index eagerly and unnecessarily fetches all data
Description: |
  Currently, the Property2Index (as well as the PropertyIndex and the NodeTypeIndex) loads all paths into a hash set. This is even the case for the getCost operation, which should be fast and therefore not load too much data.

  This strategy can cause ouf-of-memory if the result is too big. Also, loading all data is not necessary unless the user reads all rows.

  Instead, the index should only load data on demand. Also, the getCost operation should only estimate the number of read nodes, and not actually read the data.
