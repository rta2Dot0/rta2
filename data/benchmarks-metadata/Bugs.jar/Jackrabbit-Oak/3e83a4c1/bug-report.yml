BugID: OAK-1822
Summary: NodeDocument _modified may go back in time
Description: In a cluster with multiple DocumentMK instances the _modified field of
  a NodeDocument may go back in time. This will result in incorrect diff calculations
  when the DocumentNodeStore uses the _modified field to find changed nodes for a
  given revision range.
