Summary: DocumentNodeStore revision GC may lead to NPE
Description: The DocumentNodeStore revision GC may cause a NPE in a reader thread
  when the GC deletes documents currently accessed by the reader. The {{docChildrenCache}}
  is invalidated in {{VersionGarbageCollector.collectDeletedDocuments()}} after documents
  are removed in the DocumentStore. The NPE may occur if removed documents are access
  in between.
