BugID: OAK-2929
Summary: Parent of unseen children must not be removable
Description: |-
  With OAK-2673, it's now possible to have hidden intermediate nodes created concurrently.
  So, a scenario like:
  {noformat}
  start -> /:hidden
  N1 creates /:hiddent/parent/node1
  N2 creates /:hidden/parent/node2
  {noformat}
  is allowed.

  But, if N2's creation of {{parent}} got persisted later than that on N1, then N2 is currently able to delete {{parent}} even though there's {{node1}}.
