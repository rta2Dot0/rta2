BugID: OAK-2603
Summary: Failure in one of the batch in VersionGC might lead to orphaned nodes
Description: "VersionGC logic currently performs deletion of nodes in batches. For
  GC to work properly NodeDocument should always be removed in bottom-up mode i.e.
  parent node should be removed *after* child has been removed\n\nCurrently the GC
  logic deletes the NodeDocument in undefined order. In such mode if one of the batch
  fails then its possible that parent might have got deleted but the child was not
  deleted. \n\nNow in next run the child node would not be recognized as a deleted
  node because the commit root would not be found."
