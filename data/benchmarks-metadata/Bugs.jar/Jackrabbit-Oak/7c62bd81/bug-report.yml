BugID: OAK-1516
Summary: PhraseQuery fails due to missing posiion info in indexed fields
Description: "Following OAK-1487 I've introduced a regression in the indexing of fields
  on the Lucene index.\nThere are some types of queries (the ones that use property
  restrictions) that cannot run anymore.\n\nbq. /jcr:root/content/dam//*[jcr:contains(jcr:content/metadata/@dc:format,
  'application/pdf')] \n\nbq. Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: field \"dc:format\"
  was indexed without position data; cannot run PhraseQuery (term=text)\n\nI could
  not reproduce this in an unit test so far."
