BugID: OAK-4387
Summary: 'XPath: querying for nodes named "text", "element", and "rep:excerpt" fails'
Description: |-
  Queries that contain "text" or "element" as a node name currently fail, because the the parser assumes "text()" / "element(...)". Example query that fails:

  {noformat}
  /jcr:root/content/text/jcr:content//element(*,nt:unstructured)
  {noformat}

  A workaround is to use the escape mechanism, that is:

  {noformat}
  /jcr:root/tmp/_x0074_ext/jcr:content//element(*,nt:unstructured)
  {noformat}

  It looks like '(' and ')' are valid characters in node names, but to query for those characters, they need to be escaped.
