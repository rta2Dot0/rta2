BugID: OAK-2528
Summary: Entries in _commitRoot not purged
Description: Entries in _commitRoot are not purged or moved to previous documents
  if there are no changes with those revisions. Usually there is always a change associated
  with a _commitRoot, but in some cases it may happen that the only update on the
  document is for non-revisioned data like the _children flag.
