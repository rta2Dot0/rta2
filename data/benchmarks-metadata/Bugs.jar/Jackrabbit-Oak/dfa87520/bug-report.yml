BugID: OAK-2559
Summary: Lucene index rules should be case insensitive
Description: Following the lucene index definitions update, the ignored properties
  are upgraded as a lower case version, but the rest of the lucene bits (indexing)
  still take the case into account, resulting in the exclude rules being ignored,
  and properties being indexed.
