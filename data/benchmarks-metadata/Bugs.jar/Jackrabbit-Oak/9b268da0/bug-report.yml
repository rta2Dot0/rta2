BugID: OAK-596
Summary: Microkernel.diff returns empty diff when there are differences
Description: |-
  {code}
  String rev1 = mk.commit("/", "+\"node1\":{\"node2\":{\"prop1\":\"val1\",\"prop2\":\"val2\"}}", null, null);
  String rev2 = mk.commit("/", "^\"node1/node2/prop1\":\"val1 new\" ^\"node1/node2/prop2\":null", null, null);
  String diff = mk.diff(rev1, rev2, "/node1/node2", 0);
  {code}

  Here {{diff}} is empty although there are clearly differences between {{rev1}} and {{rev2}} at depth 0.
