BugID: OAK-888
Summary: PathUtils#getDepth returns 1 for empty path
Description: |-
  PathUtils#getDepths that the root path / has depth 0.
  however, passing in a empty string is accepted and returns 1.

  according to the API contract getDepth is counting the number of elements
  in the path which for "" should IMO be zero.
