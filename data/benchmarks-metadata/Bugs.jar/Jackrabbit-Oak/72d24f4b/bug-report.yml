  They indicate that copier has created files of size 0. Looking at the code flow this can happen in case while starting copying some error occurs in between. {{org.apache.lucene.store.Directory#copy}} do take care of removing the file in case of error but that is done only for IOException and not for other cases.

  As a fix the logic should ensure that local file gets deleted if the copy was not successful
