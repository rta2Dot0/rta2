BugID: OAK-3817
Summary: Hidden properties (one prefixed with ':') in lucene's analyzer configuration
  fail to construct analyzers
Description: This is similar to OAK-2524 in the sense that lucene doesn't like extra
  arguments sent its way while constructing analyzers. In some cases (like node move
  adds {{:source-path}}) we have hidden properties added to index definition nodes
  and they get passed along to lucene analyzer factories which complaint and fail.
