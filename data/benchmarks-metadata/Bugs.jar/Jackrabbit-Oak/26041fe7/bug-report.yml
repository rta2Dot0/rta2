BugID: OAK-1727
Summary: Cross foreign cluster revision comparison may be wrong
Description: Running one of the access control related benchmarks concurrently on
  a MongoDB may result in strange conflicts even when DocumentNodeStore retries the
  commit. The root cause may be a wrong revision comparison when both revision to
  compare are from a foreign cluster node and one of them is not withing the known
  seen-at revision ranges.
