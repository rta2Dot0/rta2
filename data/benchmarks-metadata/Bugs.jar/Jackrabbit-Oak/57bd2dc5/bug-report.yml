BugID: OAK-2288
Summary: DocumentNS may expose branch commit on earlier revision
Description: The DocumentNodeStore may expose the changes of a branch on a revision
  earlier than it's commit revision. This only happens when the read revision equals
  the revision of the not yet merged changes on the branch.
