BugID: OAK-3474
Summary: NodeDocument.getNodeAtRevision can go into property history traversal when
  latest rev on current doc isn't committed
Description: |-
  {{NodeDocument.getNodeAtRevision}} tried to look at latest revisions entries for each property in current document. But it just looks at the *last* entry for a given property. In case this last entry isn't committed, the code would go into previous documents to look for a committed value.
