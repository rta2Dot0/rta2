BugID: OAK-2047
Summary: Missing privileges after repository upgrade
Description: "After upgrading from Jackrabbit classic all Oak specific privileges
  are missing (rep:userManagement, rep:readNodes, rep:readProperties, rep:addProperties,\nrep:alterProperties,
  rep:removeProperties, rep:indexDefinitionManagement).\n\nThe reason seems to be
  that the {{PrivilegeInitializer}} is not run during upgrade. "
