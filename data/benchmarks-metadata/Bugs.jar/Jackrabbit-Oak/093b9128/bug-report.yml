BugID: OAK-1848
Summary: Default sync handler property mapping does not allow constant properties
Description: |+
  it would be useful, if the default sync handler user (and group) mapping could also handle constant properties and use given primary type and mixin type information. eg:

  {noformat}
  profile/nt:primaryType="sling:Folder"
  profile/sling:resourceType="sling/security/profile"
  {noformat}
