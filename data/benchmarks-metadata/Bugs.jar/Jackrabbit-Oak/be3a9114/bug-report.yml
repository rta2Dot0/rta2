BugID: OAK-2430
Summary: TARMK Cold Standby size increase due to checkpoints copy
Description: The current sync design gets confused by existing checkpoints and tries
  to copy them by value, bypassing the current storage optimization where there are
  a lot of references to existing content. this can result in a considerable size
  increase on the standby.
