BugID: OAK-3579
Summary: BackgroundLeaseUpdate not scheduled when asyncDelay=0
Description: The BackgroundLeaseUpdate extends from NodeStoreTask, which returns from
  the run() method when asyncDelay is 0. This is fine for the background read and
  update tasks. However, the lease update task must run even when asyncDelay is set
  to zero.
