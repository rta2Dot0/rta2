BugID: OAK-579
Summary: 'Query: for joins, sometimes no or the wrong index is used'
Description: "Currently, no index is used for the join condition. For example, the
  query:\n\n{code}\nselect * from [nodeTypeA] as a \ninner join [nodeTypeB] as b\non
  isdescendantnode(b, a) \nwhere lower(a.x) = 'y'\nand b.[property] is not null\n{code}\n\ncurrently
  doesn't take into account that the path of the selector 'a' is known at the time
  selector 'b' is accessed (given that selector 'a' is executed first). So in this
  case, the query would use an index on the property b.[property], even if this index
  has a very bad selectivity (many nodes with this problem), or the query would use
  the node type index on [nodeTypeB], even if there are many nodes of this type.\n\nInstead,
  most likely the query should do a traversal, using the isdescendantnode(b, a) join
  condition."
