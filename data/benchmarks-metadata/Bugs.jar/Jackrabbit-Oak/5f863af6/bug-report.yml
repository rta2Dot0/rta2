BugID: OAK-3324
Summary: Evaluation with restriction is not consistent with parent ACLs
Description: |
  consider the following ACL setup:

  {noformat}
  testuser allow rep:read,rep:write      /testroot
  testuser deny  jcr:removeNode /testroot/a  glob=*/c
  testuser allow jcr:removeNode /testroot/a  glob=*/b
  {noformat}

  now: {{hasPermission(/tesroot/a/b/c, jcr:removeNode) == false}} but the user is still able to delete the node.

  * if we change the order of the ACEs with the restriction, it works (i.e. the user can't delete)
  * if we use direct ACLs on the respective nodes, it works

  I think this is a bug...but I'm not sure if {{hasPermission}} is wrong, or the check during node deletion.
