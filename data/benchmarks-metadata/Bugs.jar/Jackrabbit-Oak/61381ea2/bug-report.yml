Summary: SQL-2 query parser doesn't detect some illegal statements
Description: |-
  The SQL-2 query parser doesn't detect some illegal statements, for example

  {code}
  select * from [nt:base] where name =+ 'Hello'
  select * from [nt:base] where name => 'Hello'
  {code}

  Both are currently interpreted as "name = 'Hello'", which is wrong.
