BugID: OAK-2260
Summary: TarMK Cold Standby can corrupt bulk segments
Description: 'There''s a race condition on the segment transfer code that may introduce
  corrupted binary segments on the secondary instance. What can happen during the
  head sync phase is that the master may send the head segment twice which will make
  the client receive&store the second segment thinking it''s a different one.
