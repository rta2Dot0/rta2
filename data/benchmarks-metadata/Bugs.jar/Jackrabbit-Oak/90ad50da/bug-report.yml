BugID: OAK-3634
Summary: RDB/MongoDocumentStore may return stale documents
Description: |-
  It appears that the implementations of the {{update}} method sometimes populate the memory cache with documents that do not reflect any current or previous state in the persistence (that is, miss changes made by another node).

  (will attach test)
