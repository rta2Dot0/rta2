BugID: OAK-4307
Summary: SegmentWriter saves references to external blobs
Description: |-
  The new {{SegmentWriteOperation#internalWriteStream}} method checks whether the input stream to write is a {{SegmentStream}}. If it's, writer will reuse existing block ids, rather than storing the whole stream.

  It should also check whether the blocks in {{SegmentStream}} comes from the same tracker / segment store. Otherwise this will create invalid references if someone invokes the {{internalWriteStream()}} method with a {{SegmentStream}} created externally.
