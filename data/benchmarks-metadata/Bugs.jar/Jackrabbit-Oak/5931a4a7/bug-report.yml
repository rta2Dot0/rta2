Summary: Non-blocking reindexing doesn't finish properly
Description: The non blocking reindexer needs to run at least 2 cycles before setting
  the index definition back to synchronous mode. Currently it is too eager to mark
  the status as 'done' which confuses the _PropertyIndexAsyncReindex_ mbean into thinking
  the indexing is over and so skipping the final round that is supposed to do the
  switch back to sync mode.
