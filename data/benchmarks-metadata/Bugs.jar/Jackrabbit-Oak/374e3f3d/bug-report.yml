BugID: OAK-4166
Summary: Simple versionable nodes are invalid after migration
Description: 'OAK-3836 introduces a support for migrating {{mix:simpleVersionable}}
  nodes from JCR2 to {{mix:versionable}} nodes in Oak. It changes the mixin type,
  however it doesn''t add required properties: {{jcr:versionHistory}}, {{jcr:baseVersion}}
  and {{jcr:predecessors}}. As a result, versioning-related methods invoked on such
  nodes doesn''t work correctly.'
