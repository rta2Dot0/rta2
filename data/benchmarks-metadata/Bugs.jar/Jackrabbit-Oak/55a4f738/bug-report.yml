BugID: OAK-644
Summary: Revisit PrivilegeDefinitionStore's use of null as a child name parameter
Description: |-
  As discussed on OAK-635, I'm extracting the PrivilegeDefinitionStore code&patch into a dedicated issue.

  Following the discussion on the dev list, I've filed it as a bug, as nulls are not considered valid input parameters.
