BugID: OAK-1108
Summary: Query constraints marked as invalid in the case of an mvp
Description: |-
  It seems that in the case of a query that has more constraints on the same property, like
  bq. //*[(@prop = 'aaa' and @prop = 'bbb' and @prop = 'ccc')]

  the filter is marked as invalid (_#isAlwaysFalse_) and the query returns no results.

  This is incorrect and affects queries that search for multi-valued properties on nodes.

  This comes from/affects OAK-1075.
