BugID: OAK-1215
Summary: Wildcards in relative property paths don't work in search expressions
Description: |-
  A search XPath of the form:
  {code}
  /jcr:root/etc/commerce/products//*[@size='M' or */@size='M']
  {code}
  returns:
  {code}
  Invalid path: *
  {code}
  (This works fine in Jackrabbit.)
