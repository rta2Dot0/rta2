  in the following journal:\n\n{code}\n>\"/source\":\"/copy\"\n{code}\n\nwhere the
  freshly created node at /moved is missing.\n\nSimilarly \n\n{code}\nhead = mk.commit(\"/\",\n
  \   \"*\\\"source\\\" : \\\"copy\\\"\" +\n    \">\\\"copy\\\" : \\\"moved\\\"\",\n
  \   head, \"\");\n{code}\n\nresults in\n\n{code}\n+\"/moved\":{}\n{code}\n\nwhere
