BugID: OAK-1959
Summary: AsyncIndexUpdate unable to cope with missing checkpoint ref
Description: |-
  The async index uses a checkpoint reference stored under the _:async_ hidden node as a base for running the index diff.
  It might happen that this reference is stale (pointing to checkpoints that no longer exist) so the async indexer logs a warning that it will reindex everything and will start its work.
  The trouble is with the #mergeWithConcurrencyCheck which does not cope well with this scenario. Even if the ref checkpoint is null, it will throw a concurrent update exception which will be logged as a misleading debug log _Concurrent update detected in the async index update_.

  Overall the code looks stuck in an endless reindexing loop.

  {code}
