BugID: OAK-4376
Summary: 'XPath: queries starting with "//" are not always converted correctly'
Description: |-
  XPath queries starting with "//" are not always converted to the expected SQL-2 query. Examples:

  {noformat}
  //element(*, oak:QueryIndexDefinition)/*
  select [jcr:path], [jcr:score], * from [oak:QueryIndexDefinition] as a

  //element(*, oak:QueryIndexDefinition)//*
  select [jcr:path], [jcr:score], * from [oak:QueryIndexDefinition] as a
  {noformat}

  This is wrong. Instead, a join should be used.
