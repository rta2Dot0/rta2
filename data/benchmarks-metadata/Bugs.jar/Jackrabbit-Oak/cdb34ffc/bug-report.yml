BugID: OAK-4291
Summary: FileStore.flush prone to races leading to corruption
Description: "There is a small window in {{FileStore.flush}} that could lead to data
  corruption: if we crash right after setting the persisted head but before any delay-flushed
  {{SegmentBufferWriter}} instance flushes (see {{SegmentBufferWriterPool.returnWriter()}})
  then that data is lost although it might already be referenced from the persisted
  head.\n\nWe need to come up with a test case for this. \n\nA possible fix would
  be to return a future from {{SegmentWriter.flush}} and rely on a completion callback.
  Such a change would most likely also be useful for OAK-3690. \n"
