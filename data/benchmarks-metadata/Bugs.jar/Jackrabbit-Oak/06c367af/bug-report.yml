BugID: OAK-4300
Summary: Cost per entry for Lucene index of type v1 should be higher than that of
  v2
Description: |-
  Currently default cost per entry for Lucene index of type
  # v1 - which uses query time aggregation
  # v2 - which uses index time aggregation

  Are same. However given that query time aggregation would require more effort it should result in a higher cost per entry.

  This fact impacts the result in cases like OAK-2081 (see last few comments) where with usage of limits both index are currently considered equals
