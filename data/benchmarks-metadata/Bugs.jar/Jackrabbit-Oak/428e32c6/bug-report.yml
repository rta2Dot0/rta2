BugID: OAK-546
Summary: 'Query: unexpected result on negative limit / offset'
Description: |-
  Currently, running a query with limit of -1 never returns any rows, the same as when using limit = 0.

  Either the query engine should fail with a negative limit or offset (IllegalArgumentException), or it should ignore negative values (unlimited result rows for limit, probably no offset for offset = -1).

  I would prefer IllegalArgumentException, but I can also live with -1 = unlimited, at least for "limit".
