BugID: OAK-1096
Summary: QueryManager does not have autorefresh
Description: |-
  Having two sessions A and B.
  A writes something for example /content/page/text = "text"
  Accessing B's QueryManager and exexcute a query for "text" nothing will be found.
  Triggering an explicit refresh on B before the query and the hit is found.

  I assume that the autorefresh is missed for that case
