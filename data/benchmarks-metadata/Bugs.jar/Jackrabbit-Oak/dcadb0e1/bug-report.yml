BugID: OAK-2246
Summary: UUID collision check is not does not work in transient space
Description: |-
  I think OAK-1037 broke the system view import.

  test case:
  1. create a new node with a uuid (referenceable, or new user)
  2. import systemview with IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REPLACE_EXISTING
  3. save()

  result:
  {noformat}
  javax.jcr.nodetype.ConstraintViolationException: OakConstraint0030: Uniqueness constraint violated at path [/] for one of the property in [jcr:uuid] having value e358efa4-89f5-3062-b10d-d7316b65649e
  {noformat}

  expected:
  * imported content should replace the existing node - even in transient space.

  note:
  * if you perform a save() after step 1, everything works.
