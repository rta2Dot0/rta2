BugID: OAK-3137
Summary: Global fulltext index returning plan for pure NodeType queries
Description: |-
  On a system having

  # Global fulltext index enabled with version V2 and {{evaluatePathRestriction}} enabled
  # NodeType index having indexing enabled for specific nodetype like cq:ClientLibraryFolder

  A query like

  {noformat}
  /jcr:root//element(*, cq:ClientLibraryFolder)
  {noformat}

  Ends up getting evaluated by fulltext index as it return plan with include all query

  *Expected*
  For such query global fulltext index should not return any plan if the path restriction is on root path with include all children
