BugID: OAK-1155
Summary: PropertyIndex cost calculation is faulty
Description: |-
  The cost calculation can easily go out of bounds when it needs to estimate (whenever there are more than 100 nodes).
  The high value it returns can be higher than the traversal index which has a max of 10M, but can be less smaller.


  For example:
    100 nodes in the index:
    with a single level /content cost is 6250000
    adding a second level /content/data cost jumps to 1.544804416E9

    101 nodes in the index:
    with a single level /content cost is 100
    adding a second level /content/data stays at 100

    100 nodes, 12 levels deep, cost is 2.147483647E9
    101 nodes, 12 levels deep, cost is 6.7108864E7
