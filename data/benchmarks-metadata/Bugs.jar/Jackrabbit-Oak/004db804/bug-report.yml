Summary: XPath queries with certain combinations of "or" conditions don't use an index
Description: |
  XPath queries with the following conditions are not converted to "union" SQL-2 queries and therefore don't use an index:

  {noformat}
  /jcr:root/content//*[((@i = '1' or @i = '2') or (@s = 'x')) and (@t = 'a' or @t = 'b')]
  {noformat}
