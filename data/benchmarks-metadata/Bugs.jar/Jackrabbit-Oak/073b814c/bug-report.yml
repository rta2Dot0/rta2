BugID: OAK-1674
Summary: Node isNew() is false in case the node is removed and added in same commit
Description: |-
  When you remove a Node /path/a transiently and add one add /path/a again.
  The transiently added Node isNew() check will be false.
  {code}
  root.getNode(name).remove();
  Node newNode = root.addNode(name);
  nowNode.isNew() => false
  {code}

  The API says
  {quote}
  Returns true if this is a new item, meaning that it exists only in transient storage on the Session and has not yet been saved. Within a transaction, isNew on an Item may return false (because the item has been saved) even if that Item is not in persistent storage (because the transaction has not yet been committed)....
