Summary: AccessDenied when modifying transiently moved item with too many ACEs
Description: |
  If at least the following preconditions are fulfilled, saving a moved item fails with access denied:

  1. there are more PermissionEntries in the PermissionEntryCache than the configured EagerCacheSize
  2. an node is moved to a location where the user has write access through a group membership
  3. a property is added to the transiently moved item

  For example:
  1. set the *eagerCacheSize* to '0'
  2. create new group *testgroup* and user *testuser*
  3. make *testuser* member of *testgroup*
  4. create nodes {{/testroot/a}} and {{/testroot/a/b}} and {{/testroot/a/c}}
  5. allow *testgroup* {{rep:write}} on {{/testroot/a}}
  6. as *testuser* create {{/testroot/a/b/item}} (to verify that the user has write access)
  7. as *testuser* move {{/testroot/a/b/item}} to {{/testroot/a/c/item}}
  8. {{save()}} -> works
  9. as *testuser* move {{/testroot/a/c/item}} back to {{/testroot/a/b/item}} AND add new property to the transient {{/testroot/a/b/item}}
  10. {{save()}} -> access denied
