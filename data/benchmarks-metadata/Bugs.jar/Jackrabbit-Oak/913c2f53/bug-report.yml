BugID: OAK-1932
Summary: TarMK compaction can create mixed segments
Description: As described in http://markmail.org/message/ujkqdlthudaortxf, commits
  that occur while the compaction operation is running can make the compacted segments
  contain references to older data segments, which prevents old data from being reclaimed
  during cleanup.
