Summary: NodeType index doesn't respect the declaringNodeTypes setting
Description: |-
  Following the OAK-1150 discussion, I've noticed that the node type index doesn't respect the declaringNodeTypes setting.
  Setting a restriction on the node type index definition breaks the index - there are 0 query hits.
