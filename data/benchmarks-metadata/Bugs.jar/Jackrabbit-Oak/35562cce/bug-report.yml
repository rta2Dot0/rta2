Summary: PropertyIndex only considers the cost of a single indexed property
Description: |-
  The existing PropertyIndex loops through the PropertyRestriction objects in the Filter and essentially only calculates the cost of the first indexed property. This isn't actually the first property in the query and Filter.propertyRestrictions is a HashMap.

  More confusingly, the plan for a query with multiple indexed properties outputs *all* indexed properties, even though only the first one is used.

  For queries with multiple indexed properties, the cheapest property index should be used in all three relevant places: when calculating the cost, when executing the query, and when producing the plan.
