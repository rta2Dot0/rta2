Summary: DocumentNodeStore.dispose() may leave repository in an inconsistent state
Description: "The repository may become inconsistent when a commit happens while the
  DocumentNodeStore is disposed. \n\nThe node store writes back pending _lastRevs
  and then unset the active flag in the clusterNodes collection. It is possible a
  commit gets through even after the _lastRevs had been updated and the active flag
  is cleared. This means the missing _lastRev updates will not be recovered on a restart
  or by another cluster node."
