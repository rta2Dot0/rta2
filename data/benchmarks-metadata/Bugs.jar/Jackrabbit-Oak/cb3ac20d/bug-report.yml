Summary: Lucene Index should ignore property existence checks
Description: |-
  Some optimizations on the query engine transform certain clauses in property existence checks. ie (p = 'somevalue' turns into 'p is not null').

  This doesn't play well with lucene as it can not  effectively build a 'not null' query, even worse the query doesn't return any results.

  As a fix I'll just skip the existence constraints from the generated lucene query.
