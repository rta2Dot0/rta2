BugID: OAK-2250
Summary: Lucene Index property definition is ignored if its not in includePropertyNames
  config
Description: "Lucene index property definition will not be used unless that property
  is in includePropertyNames config. This enforces including that property in includePropertyNames.\nincludePropertyNames
  restricts all properties from getting indexed, so user is now enforced to include
  all properties in includePropertyNames to be indexed.\n "
