BugID: OAK-748
Summary: 'ContentMirrorStoreStrategy #insert fails to enforce uniqueness and is slow'
Description: |-
  Following OAK-734 I've noticed that the _ContentMirrorStoreStrategy_ fails to enforce the uniqueness constraints assumed on the #insert method.

  It is also responsible for a slowdown on the #insert method because of the behavior change of the Property2Index (very frequent saves instead of a bulk one).
