Summary: Mixin based rules not working for relative properties
Description: |-
  If an indexing rule is defined for mixin then it does not work as expected for relative properties.

  Issue here being that most of logic in Aggregate class (which is used for relative property handling also) relies on nodes primaryType and does not account for mixin type
