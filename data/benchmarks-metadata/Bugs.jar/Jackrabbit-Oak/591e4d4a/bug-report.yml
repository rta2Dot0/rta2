Summary: AsyncIndexUpdate may resurrect nodes
Description: There is a race condition in the AsyncIndexUpdate.run() method. The implementation
  creates a checkpoint used as the after node state for the comparison with the previous
  checkpoint. In a next step a builder is created from the current root state of the
  node store. Node removed between the checkpoint call and retrieving the root state
  may get resurrected by the AsyncIndexUpdate.
