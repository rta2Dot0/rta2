Summary: UnmergedBranch state growing with empty BranchCommit leading to performance
  degradation
Description: "In some cluster deployment cases it has been seen that in memory state
  of UnmergedBranches contains large number of empty commits. For e.g. in  one of
  of the runs there were 750 entries in the UnmergedBranches and each Branch had empty
  branch commits.\n\nIf there are large number of UnmergedBranches then read performance
  would degrade as for determining revision validity currently logic scans all branches\n\nBelow
  is some part of UnmergedBranch state\n\n{noformat}\nBranch 1\n1 -> br146d2edb7a7-0-1

  Suggested that these branch might be for those revision which have resulted in a
  collision and upon checking it indeed appears to be the case  (value true in brackets
  above indicate that). Further given the age of such revision it looks like they
  get populated upon startup itself\n\n*Fix*\n* Need to check why we need to populate
  the UnermgedBranch\n* Possibly implement some purge job which would remove such
  stale entries \n\n"
