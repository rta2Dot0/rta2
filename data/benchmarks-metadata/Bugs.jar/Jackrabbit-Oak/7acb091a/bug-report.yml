Summary: Branch conflicts not detected by MongoMK
Description: |-
  MongoMK does not correctly detect conflicts when changes are committed into multiple branches concurrently and then merged back.

  ConflictTest already covers conflict detection for non-branch commits and mixed branch/non-branch changes, but is missing tests for conflicting branches. I'll commit an ignored test to illustrate the problem.
