BugID: OAK-1094
Summary: CacheLIRS implementation incomplete
Description: The current CacheLIRS implementation is not complete and e.g. does not
  provide a write through ConcurrentMap view on {{asMap()}}. For OAK-1088 it would
  be good to have this implementation as it allows conditional and atomic updates
  of cache entries.
