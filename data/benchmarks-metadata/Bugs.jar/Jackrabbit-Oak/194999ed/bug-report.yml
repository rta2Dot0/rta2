BugID: OAK-3333
Summary: SplitOperations purges _commitRoot entries too eagerly
Description: |-
  OAK-2528 introduced purging of _commitRoot entries without associated local changes on the document. Those _commitRoot entries are created when a child nodes is added and the _children flag is touched on the parent.

  The purge operation is too eager and removes all such entries, which may result in an undetected hierarchy conflict.
