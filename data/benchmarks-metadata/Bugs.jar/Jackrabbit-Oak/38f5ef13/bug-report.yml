BugID: OAK-3104
Summary: Version garbage collector doesn't collect a rolled back document if it was
  never deleted
Description: |-
  If a commit gets rolled back it can leave (in case the document was never deleted explicitly) a document in a state like:
  {noformat}
  {
         "_id" : "7:/etc/workflow/packages/2014/10/12/rep:ours",
         "_deleted" : {

         },
         "_commitRoot" : {

         },
         "jcr:primaryType" : {

         },
         "_modified" : NumberLong(1413126245),
         "_children" : true,
         "_modCount" : NumberLong(2)
  }
  {noformat}

  If the path is fairly busy, the document can get created naturally later and then follow the usual cycle. But, at times, such documents are ephemeral in nature and never re-used. In those cases, such documents can remain silently without getting collected.
