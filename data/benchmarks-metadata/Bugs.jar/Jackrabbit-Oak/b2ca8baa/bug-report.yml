BugID: OAK-1035
Summary: 'Property Index: cost calculation is wrong (zero) when searching for many
  values'
Description: "Currently, for queries of the form \n\n{code}\nselect * from [nt:unstructured]
  where type = 'xyz'\n{code}\n\nthe node type index is used in some cases, even if
  there is an index on the property \"type\". The reason is that the cost for the
  node type index is 0 due to a bug. The node type index internally uses the property
  index on the property \"jcr:primaryType\", and asks for the cost using all possible
  children node types of \"nt:unstructured\". The returned cost is 0 because of this
  bug. The cost estimation is an extrapolation of the number of entries for the first
  3 values. It is currently coded as:\n\n{code}\ncount = count / size / i;\n{code}\n\nwhen
  in fact it should be written as:\n\n{code}\ncount = count * size / i;\n{code}\n"
