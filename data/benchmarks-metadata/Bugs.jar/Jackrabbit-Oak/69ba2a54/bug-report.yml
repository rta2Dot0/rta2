BugID: OAK-1308
Summary: XPath queries with ISO9075 escaped properties don't work
Description: "XPath queries with ISO9075 escaped properties or relative path don't
  work as expected. Example: \n\n{code}\n/jcr:root//*/element(*,rep:User)[_x002e_tokens/@jcr:primaryType]\n{code}\n\nThe
  relative property should be converted to \".tokens/@jcr:primaryType\", but is not.\n\nThis
  issue is similar to OAK-1000, but for property names or relative properties."
