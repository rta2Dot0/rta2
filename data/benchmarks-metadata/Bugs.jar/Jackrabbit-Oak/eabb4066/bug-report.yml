Summary: SQL2 query with union, limit and offset can return invalid results
Description: |
  when using order, limit and offset and a SQL2 query that contains an union of two subqueries that have common results can return invalid results

  Example: assuming content tree /test/a/b/c/d/e exists
  {code:sql}
  SELECT [jcr:path] FROM [nt:base] AS a WHERE ISDESCENDANTNODE(a, '/test') UNION SELECT [jcr:path] FROM [nt:base] AS a WHERE ISDESCENDANTNODE(a, '/test')" ORDER BY [jcr:path]
  {code}
  with limit=3 and offset 2 returns only one row ( instead of 3 )

  the correct result set is
  {noformat}
  /test/a/b/c
  /test/a/b/c/d
  /test/a/b/c/d/e
  {noformat}
