BugID: OAK-4432
Summary: 'Ignore files in the root directory of the FileDataStore in #getAllIdentifiers'
Description: "The call to OakFileDataStore#getAllIdentifiers should ignore the the
  files directly at the root of the DataStore (These files are used for SharedDataStore
  etc). This does not cause any functional problems but leads to logging warning in
  the logs. \nThere is already a check but it fails when the data store root is specified
  as a relative path."
