BugID: OAK-2864
Summary: XPath backwards compatibility issue with false() and true()
Description: |-
  In JR2 (actually CRX 2) both of the following queries for nodes with a
  boolean property can be parsed, however only query (a) returns search
  results.
  {noformat}
      (a) /jcr:root/test//*[@foo = true()]
      (b) /jcr:root/test//*[@foo = true]
  {noformat}

  On Oak 1.2, query (a) results in an exception\[0\] and query (b) returns
  search results.
