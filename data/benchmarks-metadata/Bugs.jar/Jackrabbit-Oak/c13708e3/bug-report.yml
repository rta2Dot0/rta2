BugID: OAK-3872
Summary: "[RDB] Updated blob still deleted even if deletion interval lower"
Description: "If an existing blob is uploaded again, the timestamp of the existing
  entry is updated in the meta table. Subsequently if a call to delete (RDBBlobStore#countDeleteChunks)
  is made with {{maxLastModifiedTime}} parameter of less than the updated time above,
  the entry in the meta table is not touched but the data table entry is wiped out.
