Summary: Full-text search on the traversing index fails if the condition contains
  a slash
Description: "A full-text search on the traversing index falls back to a sort of manual
  evaluation of results. \nThis is handled by the _FullTextTerm_ class, and it appears
  that it passes the constraint text through a cleanup process where it strips most
  of the characters that are neither _Character.isLetterOrDigit(c)_ not in the list
  _+-:&_\n\nI'm not exactly sure where this list comes from, but I see the '/' character
  is missing which causes a certain type of query to fail.\n\nExample:\n{code}\n//*[jcr:contains(.,
  'text/plain')]\n{code}\n\n"
