BugID: OAK-4066
Summary: Suggestion dictionary don't update after suggestUpdateFrequencyMinutes unless
  something else causes index update
Description: |-
  Currently, suggestions building is tied at the end of indexing cycle. Along with that we check if diff between currTime and lastSugguestionBuildTime is more than {{suggestUpdateFrequencyMinutes}} before deciding to build suggestions or not.

  This allows for suggestions not getting updated if:
  * At T1 suggestions are built
  * At T2 an index update takes place but suggestions aren't rebuilt because not enough time has passed since T1
  * Now at T3 (after sufficient time), changes at T2 won't show up for suggestions until some other index change happens.

  We should probably see track about last changes in index (at T2) and use that too while running indexing cycle at T3.
