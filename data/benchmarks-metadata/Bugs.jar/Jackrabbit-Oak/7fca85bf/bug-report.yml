Summary: IllegalStateException for ValueMap on _revisions
Description: An IllegalStateException may be thrown by the MergeSortedIterator when
  _revisions on the root document are read with the ValueMap implementation. It only
  happens when the local _revisions map has entries that are lower than the most recent
  split document.
