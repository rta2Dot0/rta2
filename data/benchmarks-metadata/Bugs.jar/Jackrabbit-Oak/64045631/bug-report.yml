Summary: Inconsistent state in Mongo/KernelRootBuilder
Description: The state of Kernel- and MongoRootBuilder may turn inconsistent when
  a NodeStoreBranch.merge() performs a rebase followed by a failed merge on the underlying
  storage. The head and base are not properly updated to reflect the successful rebase.
