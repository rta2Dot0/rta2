Summary: Missing commit hooks in upgrade
Description: There's a TODO in the RepositoryUpgrade class about missing commit hooks.
  For example the PermissionHook isn't currently run as a part of the upgrade, which
  breaks permission evaluation even though the actual ACL nodes are present after
  the upgrade.
