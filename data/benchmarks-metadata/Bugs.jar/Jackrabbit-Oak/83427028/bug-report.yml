BugID: OAK-1020
Summary: Property value converion ignores reisdual property definition
Description: |-
  Assume following node type which a property defined with type and a residual unnamed property also defined

  {noformat}
  [oak:foo]
   - stringProp (String)
   - * (undefined)
  {noformat}

  For such node type if a property {{stringProp}} is being set with a binary value then Oak converts it into a String property thereby causing binary stream to change. In JR2 conversion would not happen as conversion logic treats setting (stringProp,BINARY) as a residual property
