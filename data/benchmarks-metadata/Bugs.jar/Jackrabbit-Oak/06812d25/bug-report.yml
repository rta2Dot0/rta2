BugID: OAK-3367
Summary: Boosting fields not working as expected
Description: "When the boost support was added the intention was to support a usecase
  like \n\n{quote}\nFor the fulltext search on a node where the fulltext content is
  derived from multiple field it should be possible to boost specific text contributed
  by individual field. Meaning that if a title field is boosted more than description,
  the title (part) in the fulltext field will mean more than the description (part)
  in the fulltext field.\n{quote}\n\nThis would enable a user to perform a search
  like _/jcr:root/content/geometrixx-outdoors/en//element(*, cq:Page)\\[jcr:contains(.,
  'Keyword')\\]_ and get a result where pages having 'Keyword' in title come above
  in search result compared to those where Keyword is found in description.\n\nCurrent
  implementation just sets the boost while add the field value to fulltext field with
  the intention that Lucene would use the boost as explained above. However it does
  not work like that and boost value gets multiplies with other field and hence boosting
  does not work as expected"
