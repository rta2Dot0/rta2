BugID: OAK-766
Summary: 'TreeImpl#*Location: unable retrieve child location if access to parent is
  denied'
Description: |-
  as a consequence of OAK-709 we now have an issue with the way
  SessionDelegate and Root#getLocation access a node in the hierarchy
  which has an ancestor which is not accessible.

  specifically RootImpl#getLocation will be served a NullLocation for the
  first ancestor which is not accessible and consequently any accessible
  child node cannot be accessed.

  in order to reproduce the issue you may:

  - change AccessControlConfigurationImpl to use PermissionProviderImpl instead
    of the tmp solution
  - and run o.a.j.oak.jcr.security.authorization.ReadTest#testReadDenied
