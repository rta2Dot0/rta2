BugID: MATH-927
Summary: GammaDistribution cloning broken
Description: |-
  Serializing a GammaDistribution and deserializing it, does not result in a cloned distribution that produces the same samples.

  Cause: GammaDistribution inherits from AbstractRealDistribution, which implements Serializable. AbstractRealDistribution has random, in which we have a Well19937c instance, which inherits from AbstractWell. AbstractWell implements Serializable. AbstractWell inherits from BitsStreamGenerator, which is not Serializable, but does have a private field 'nextGaussian'.

  Solution: Make BitStreamGenerator implement Serializable as well.

  This probably affects other distributions as well.
