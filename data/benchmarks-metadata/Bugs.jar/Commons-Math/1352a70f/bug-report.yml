BugID: MATH-723
Summary: BitStreamGenerators (MersenneTwister, Well generators) do not clear normal
  deviate cache on setSeed
Description: The BitStream generators generate normal deviates (for nextGaussian)
  in pairs, caching the last value generated. When reseeded, the cache should be cleared;
  otherwise seeding two generators with the same value is not guaranteed to generate
  the same sequence.
