Summary: Correlated random vector generator fails (silently) when faced with zero
  rows in covariance matrix
Description: "The following three matrices (which are basically permutations of each
  other) produce different results when sampling a multi-variate Gaussian with the
  help of CorrelatedRandomVectorGenerator (sample covariances calculated in R, based
  on 10,000 samples):\n\nArray2DRowRealMatrix{\n{0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0},\n{0.0,0.013445532,0.01039469,0.009881156,0.010499559},\n{0.0,0.01039469,0.023006616,0.008196856,0.010732709},\n{0.0,0.009881156,0.008196856,0.019023866,0.009210099},\n{0.0,0.010499559,0.010732709,0.009210099,0.019107243}}\n\n>

  0.019260317\n\n\nI've traced this back to the RectangularCholeskyDecomposition,
  which does not seem to handle the second matrix very well (decompositions in the
  same order as the matrices above):\n\nCorrelatedRandomVectorGenerator.getRootMatrix()
  = \nArray2DRowRealMatrix{{0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0},{0.0759577418122063,0.0876125188474239,0.0,0.0,0.0},{0.07764443622513505,0.05132821221460752,0.11976381821791235,0.0,0.0},{0.06662930527909404,0.05501661744114585,0.0016662506519307997,0.10749324207653632,0.0},{0.13822895138139477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0}}\nCorrelatedRandomVectorGenerator.getRank()
  = 5\n\nCorrelatedRandomVectorGenerator.getRootMatrix() = \nArray2DRowRealMatrix{{0.0759577418122063,0.034512751379448724,0.0},{0.07764443622513505,0.13029949164628746,0.0},{0.0,0.0,0.0},{0.06662930527909404,0.023203936694855674,0.0},{0.13822895138139477,0.0,0.0}}\nCorrelatedRandomVectorGenerator.getRank()
  = 3\n\nCorrelatedRandomVectorGenerator.getRootMatrix() = \nArray2DRowRealMatrix{{0.0759577418122063,0.034512751379448724,0.033913748226348225,0.07303890149947785},{0.07764443622513505,0.13029949164628746,0.0,0.0},{0.06662930527909404,0.023203936694855674,0.11851573313229945,0.0},{0.13822895138139477,0.0,0.0,0.0}}\nCorrelatedRandomVectorGenerator.getRank()
  = 4\n\nClearly, the rank of each of these matrices should be 4. The first matrix
  does not lead to incorrect results, but the second one does. Unfortunately, I don't
  know enough about the Cholesky decomposition to find the flaw in the implementation,
  and I could not find documentation for the \"rectangular\" variant (also not at
  the links provided in the javadoc)."
