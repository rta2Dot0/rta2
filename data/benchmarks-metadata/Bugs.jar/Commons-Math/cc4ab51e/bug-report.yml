BugID: MATH-1136
Summary: BinomialDistribution deals with degenerate cases incorrectly
Description: |-
  The following calculation returns false results:

  {{new BinomialDistribution(0, 0.01).logProbability(0)}}

  It evaluates to Double.NaN when it should be 0 (cf., for example, "dbinom(0, 0, 0.01, log=T)" in R).

  I attach a patch dealing with the problem. The patch also adds a test for this bug.
