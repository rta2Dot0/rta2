Summary: RandomDataImpl.nextInt does not distribute uniformly for negative lower bound
Description: |-
  When using the RandomDataImpl.nextInt function to get a uniform sample in a [lower, upper] interval, when the lower value is less than zero, the output is not uniformly distributed, as the lowest value is practically never returned.

  See the attached NextIntUniformTest.java file. It uses a [-3, 5] interval. For several values between 0 and 1, testNextIntUniform1 prints the return value of RandomDataImpl.nextInt (as double and as int). We see that -2 through 5 are returned several times. The -3 value however, is only returned for 0.0, and is thus under-respresented in the integer samples. The output of test method testNextIntUniform2 also clearly shows that value -3 is never sampled.
