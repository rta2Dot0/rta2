Summary: EigenDecomposition.Solver should consider tiny values 0 for purposes of determining
  singularity
Description: |-
  EigenDecomposition.Solver tests for singularity by comparing eigenvalues to 0 for exact equality. Elsewhere in the class and in the code, of course, very small values are considered 0. This causes the solver to consider some singular matrices as non-singular.

  The patch here includes a test as well showing the behavior -- the matrix is clearly singular but isn't considered as such since one eigenvalue are ~1e-14 rather than exactly 0.

  (What I am not sure of is whether we should really be evaluating the *norm* of the imaginary eigenvalues rather than real/imag components separately. But the javadoc says the solver only supports real eigenvalues anyhow, so it's kind of moot since imag=0 for all eigenvalues.)
