Summary: Inconsistent result from Levenberg-Marquardt
Description: Levenberg-Marquardt (its method doOptimize) returns a VectorialPointValuePair.  However,
  the class holds the optimum point, the vector of the objective function, the cost
  and residuals.  The value returns by doOptimize does not always corresponds to the
  point which leads to the residuals and cost
