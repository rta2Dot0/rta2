BugID: MATH-1058
Summary: Beta, LogNormalDistribution, WeibullDistribution give slightly wrong answer
  for extremely small args due to log/exp inaccuracy
Description: |-
  Background for those who aren't familiar: math libs like Math and FastMath have two mysterious methods, log1p and expm1. log1p(x) = log(1+x) and expm1(x) = exp(x)-1 mathetmatically, but can return a correct answer even when x was small, where floating-point error due to the addition/subtraction introduces a relatively large error.

  There are three instances in the code that can employ these specialized methods and gain a measurable improvement in accuracy. See patch and tests for an example -- try the tests without the code change to see the error.
