BugID: MATH-891
Summary: SpearmansCorrelation fails when using NaturalRanking together with NaNStrategy.REMOVED
Description: |-
  As reported by Martin Rosellen on the users mailinglist:

  Using a NaturalRanking with a REMOVED NaNStrategy can result in an exception when NaN are contained in the input arrays.

  The current implementation just removes the NaN values where they occur, without taken care to remove the corresponding values in the other array.
