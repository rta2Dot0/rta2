BugID: MATH-1203
Summary: getKernel fails for buckets with only multiple instances of the same value
  in random.EmpiricalDistribution
Description: |-
  After loading a set of values into an EmpericalDistribution, assume that there's a case where a single bin ONLY contains multiple instances of the same value.  In this case the standard deviation will equal zero.  This will fail when getKernel attempts to create a NormalDistribution.  The other case where stddev=0 is when there is only a single value in the bin, and this is handled by returning a ConstantRealDistribution rather than a NormalDistrbution.
