BugID: MATH-778
Summary: Dfp Dfp.multiply(int x) does not comply with the general contract FieldElement.multiply(int
  n)
Description: In class {{org.apache.commons.math3.Dfp}},  the method {{multiply(int
  n)}} is limited to {{0 <= n <= 9999}}. This is not consistent with the general contract
  of {{FieldElement.multiply(int n)}}, where there should be no limitation on the
  values of {{n}}.
