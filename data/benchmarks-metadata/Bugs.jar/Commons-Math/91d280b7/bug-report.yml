BugID: MATH-1005
Summary: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in MathArrays.linearCombination
Description: |-
  When MathArrays.linearCombination is passed arguments with length 1, it throws an ArrayOutOfBoundsException. This is caused by this line:

  double prodHighNext = prodHigh[1];

  linearCombination should check the length of the arguments and fall back to simple multiplication if length == 1.
