BugID: MATH-859
Summary: Fix and then deprecate isSupportXxxInclusive in RealDistribution interface
Description: |
  The conclusion from [1] was never implemented. We should deprecate these
  properties from the RealDistribution interface, but since removal
  will have to wait until 4.0, we should agree on a precise
  definition and fix the code to match it in the mean time.

  The definition that I propose is that isSupportXxxInclusive means
  that when the density function is applied to the upper or lower
  bound of support returned by getSupportXxxBound, a finite (i.e. not
  infinite), not NaN value is returned.
