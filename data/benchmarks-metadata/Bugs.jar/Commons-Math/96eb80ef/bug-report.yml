BugID: MATH-1230
Summary: SimplexSolver returning wrong answer from optimize
Description: |-
  SimplexSolver fails for the following linear program:

  min 2x1 +15x2 +18x3

  Subject to

    -x1 +2x2  -6x3 <=-10
              x2  +2x3 <= 6
     2x1      +10x3 <= 19
      -x1  +x2       <= -2
      x1,x2,x3 >= 0

  Solution should be
  x1 = 7
  x2 = 0
  x3 = 1/2
  Objective function = 23

  Instead, it is returning
  x1 = 9.5
  x2 = 1/8
  x3 = 0
  Objective function = 20.875

  Constraint number 1 is violated by this answer
