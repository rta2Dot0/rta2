BugID: MATH-482
Summary: FastMath.max(50.0f, -50.0f) => -50.0f; should be +50.0f
Description: |-
  FastMath.max(50.0f, -50.0f) => -50.0f; should be +50.0f.

  This is because the wrong variable is returned.

  The bug was not detected by the test case "testMinMaxFloat()" because that has a bug too - it tests doubles, not floats.
