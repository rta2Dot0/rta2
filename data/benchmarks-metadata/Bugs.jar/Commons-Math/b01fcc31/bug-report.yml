BugID: MATH-290
Summary: NullPointerException in SimplexTableau.initialize
Description: |-
  SimplexTableau throws a NullPointerException when no solution can be found instead of a NoFeasibleSolutionException

  Here is the code that causes the NullPointerException:

  LinearObjectiveFunction f = new LinearObjectiveFunction(new double[] { 1, 5 }, 0 );
  Collection<LinearConstraint> constraints = new ArrayList<LinearConstraint>();
  constraints.add(new LinearConstraint(new double[] { 2, 0 }, Relationship.GEQ, -1.0));

  RealPointValuePair solution = new SimplexSolver().optimize(f, constraints, GoalType.MINIMIZE, true);

  Note: Tested both with Apache Commons Math 2.0 release and SVN trunk
