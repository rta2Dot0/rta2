BugID: MATH-555
Summary: MathUtils round method should propagate rather than wrap Runitme exceptions
Description: MathUtils.round(double, int, int) can generate IllegalArgumentException
  or ArithmeticException.  Instead of wrapping these exceptions in MathRuntimeException,
  the conditions under which these exceptions can be thrown should be documented and
  the exceptions should be propagated directly to the caller.
