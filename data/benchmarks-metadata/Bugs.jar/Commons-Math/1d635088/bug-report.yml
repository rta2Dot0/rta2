BugID: MATH-1300
Summary: BitsStreamGenerator#nextBytes(byte[]) is wrong
Description: |-
  Sequential calls to the BitsStreamGenerator#nextBytes(byte[]) must generate the same sequence of bytes, no matter by chunks of which size it was divided. This is also how java.util.Random#nextBytes(byte[]) works.

  When nextBytes(byte[]) is called with a bytes array of length multiple of 4 it makes one unneeded call to next(int) method. This is wrong and produces an inconsistent behavior of classes like MersenneTwister.

  I made a new implementation of the BitsStreamGenerator#nextBytes(byte[]) see attached code.
