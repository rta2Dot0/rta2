BugID: MATH-1068
Summary: KendallsCorrelation suffers from integer overflow for large arrays.
Description: |-
  For large array size (say, over 5,000), numPairs > 10 million.
  in line 258, (numPairs - tiedXPairs) * (numPairs - tiedYPairs) possibly > 100 billion, which will cause an integer overflow, resulting in a negative number, which will result in the end result in a NaN since the square-root of that number is calculated.
  This can easily be solved by changing line 163 to
  final long numPairs = ((long)n) * (n - 1) / 2; // to avoid overflow
