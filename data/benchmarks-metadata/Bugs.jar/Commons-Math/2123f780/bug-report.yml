Summary: Complex Add and Subtract handle NaN arguments differently, but javadoc contracts
  are the same
Description: |
  For both Complex add and subtract, the javadoc states that

  {code}
       * If either this or <code>rhs</code> has a NaN value in either part,
       * {@link #NaN} is returned; otherwise Inifinite and NaN values are
       * returned in the parts of the result according to the rules for
       * {@link java.lang.Double} arithmetic
  {code}

  Subtract includes an isNaN test and returns Complex.NaN if either complex argument isNaN; but add omits this test.  The test should be added to the add implementation (actually restored, since this looks like a code merge problem going back to 1.1).
