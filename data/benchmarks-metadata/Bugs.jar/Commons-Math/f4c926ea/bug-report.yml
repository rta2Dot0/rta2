BugID: MATH-1117
Summary: twod.PolygonsSet.getSize produces NullPointerException if BSPTree has no
  nodes
Description: |-
  org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.euclidean.twod.PolygonsSet.getSize() uses a tree internally:

  final BSPTree<Euclidean2D> tree = getTree(false);

  However, if that tree contains no data, it seems that the reference returned is null, which causes a subsequent NullPointerException.

  Probably an exception with a message ("tree has no data") would clarify that this is an API usage error.
