BugID: MATH-1257
Summary: NormalDistribution.cumulativeProbability() suffers from cancellation
Description: "I see the following around line 194:\n{noformat}\n        return 0.5
  * (1 + Erf.erf(dev / (standardDeviation * SQRT2)));\n{noformat}\n\nWhen erf() returns
  a very small value, this cancels in the addition with the \"1.0\" which leads to
  poor precision in the results.\n\nI would suggest changing this line to read more
  like:\n{noformat}\nreturn 0.5 * Erf.erfc( -dev / standardDeviation * SQRT2 );\n{noformat}
  \n\nShould you want some test cases for \"extreme values\" (one might argue that
  within 10 standard deviations isn't all that extreme) then you can check the following:
  http://www.jstatsoft.org/v52/i07/ then look in the v52i07-xls.zip at replication-01-distribution-standard-normal.xls\n\nI
  think you will also find that evaluation of expressions such as {noformat}NormalDistribution(
  0, 1 ).cumulativeProbability( -10.0 );{noformat}\nare pretty far off."
