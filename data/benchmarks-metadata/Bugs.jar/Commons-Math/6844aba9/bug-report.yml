BugID: MATH-904
Summary: 'FastMath.pow deviates from Math.pow for negative, finite base values with
  an exponent 2^52 < y < 2^53 '
Description: |-
  As reported by Jeff Hain:

  pow(double,double):
  Math.pow(-1.0,5.000000000000001E15) = -1.0
  FastMath.pow(-1.0,5.000000000000001E15) = 1.0
  ===> This is due to considering that power is an even
  integer if it is >= 2^52, while you need to test
  that it is >= 2^53 for it.
  ===> replace
  "if (y >= TWO_POWER_52 || y <= -TWO_POWER_52)"
  with
  "if (y >= 2*TWO_POWER_52 || y <= -2*TWO_POWER_52)"
  and that solves it.
