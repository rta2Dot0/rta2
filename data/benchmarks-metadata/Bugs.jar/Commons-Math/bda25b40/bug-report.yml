BugID: MATH-1051
Summary: EigenDecomposition may not converge for certain matrices
Description: |-
  Jama-1.0.3 contains a bugfix for certain matrices where the original code goes into an infinite loop.

  The commons-math translations would throw a MaxCountExceededException, so fails to compute the eigen decomposition.

  Port the fix from jama to CM.
