Summary: Rare case for updateMembershipMatrix() in FuzzyKMeansClusterer
Description: |-
  The function updateMembershipMatrix() in FuzzyKMeansClusterer assigns the points to the cluster with the highest membership. Consider the following case:

  If the distance between a point and the cluster center is zero, then we will have a cluster membership of one, and all other membership values will be zero.

  So the if condition:
  if (membershipMatrix[i][j] > maxMembership) {
                      maxMembership = membershipMatrix[i][j];
                      newCluster = j;
  }
  will never be true during the for loop and newCluster will remain -1. This will throw an exception because of the line:
  clusters.get(newCluster)
                      .addPoint(point);

  Adding the following condition can solve the problem:
  double d;
  if (sum == 0)
  d = 1;
  else
  d = 1.0/sum;
