Summary: ResizableDoubleArray is not thread-safe yet has some synch. methods
Description: |
  ResizableDoubleArray has several synchronised methods, but is not thread-safe, because class variables are not always accessed using the lock.

  Is the class supposed to be thread-safe?

  If so, all accesses (read and write) need to be synch.

  If not, the synch. qualifiers could be dropped.

  In any case, the protected fields need to be made private.
