Summary: '[math] Complex Tanh for "big" numbers'
Description: |
  Hi,

  In Complex.java the tanh is computed with the following formula:

  tanh(a + bi) = sinh(2a)/(cosh(2a)+cos(2b)) + [sin(2b)/(cosh(2a)+cos(2b))]i

  The problem that I'm finding is that as soon as "a" is a "big" number,
  both sinh(2a) and cosh(2a) are infinity and then the method tanh returns in
  the real part NaN (infinity/infinity) when it should return 1.0.

  Wouldn't it be appropiate to add something as in the FastMath library??:

  if (real>20.0){
        return createComplex(1.0, 0.0);
  }
  if (real<-20.0){
        return createComplex(-1.0, 0.0);
  }


  Best regards,

  JBB
