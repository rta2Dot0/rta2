BugID: MATH-1241
Summary: Digamma calculation produces SOE on NaN argument
Description: |-
  Digamma doesn't work particularly well with NaNs.

  How to reproduce: call Gamma.digamma(Double.NaN)

  Expected outcome: returns NaN or throws a meaningful exception

  Real outcome: crashes with StackOverflowException, as digamma enters infinite recursion.
