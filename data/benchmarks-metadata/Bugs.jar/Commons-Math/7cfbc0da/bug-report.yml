Summary: arcs set split covers full circle instead of being empty
Description: |-
  When splitting an arcs set using an arc very close to one of the boundaries (but not at the boundary), the algorithm confuses cases for which end - start = 2pi from cases for which end - start = epsilon.

  The following test case shows such a failure:
  {code}
      @Test
      public void testSplitWithinEpsilon() {
          double epsilon = 1.0e-10;
          double a = 6.25;
          double b = a - 0.5 * epsilon;
          ArcsSet set = new ArcsSet(a - 1, a, epsilon);
          Arc arc = new Arc(b, b + FastMath.PI, epsilon);
          ArcsSet.Split split = set.split(arc);
          Assert.assertEquals(set.getSize(), split.getPlus().getSize(),  epsilon);
          Assert.assertNull(split.getMinus());
      }
  {code}

  The last assertion (split.getMinus() being null) fails, as with current code split.getMinus() covers the full circle from 0 to 2pi.
