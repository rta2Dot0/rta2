BugID: MATH-343
Summary: Brent solver doesn't throw IllegalArgumentException when initial guess has
  the wrong sign
Description: Javadoc for "public double solve(final UnivariateRealFunction f, final
  double min, final double max, final double initial)" claims that "if the values
  of the function at the three points have the same sign" an IllegalArgumentException
  is thrown. This case isn't even checked.
