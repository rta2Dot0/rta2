BugID: MATH-713
Summary: Negative value with restrictNonNegative
Description: |-
  Problem: commons-math-2.2 SimplexSolver.

  A variable with 0 coefficient may be assigned a negative value nevertheless restrictToNonnegative flag in call:
  SimplexSolver.optimize(function, constraints, GoalType.MINIMIZE, true);

  Function
  1 * x + 1 * y + 0

  Constraints:
  1 * x + 0 * y = 1

  Result:
  x = 1; y = -1;

  Probably variables with 0 coefficients are omitted at some point of computation and because of that the restrictions do not affect their values.
