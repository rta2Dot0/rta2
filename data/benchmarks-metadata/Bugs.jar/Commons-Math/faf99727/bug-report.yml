BugID: MATH-1096
Summary: implementation of smallest enclosing ball algorithm sometime fails
Description: |-
  The algorithm for finding the smallest ball is designed in such a way the radius should be strictly increasing at each iteration.

  In some cases, it is not true and one iteration has a smaller ball. In most cases, there is no consequence, there is just one or two more iterations. However, in rare cases discovered while testing 3D, this generates an infinite loop.

  Some very short offending cases have already been identified and added to the test suite. These cases are currently deactivated in the main repository while I am already working on them. The test cases are

  * WelzlEncloser2DTest.testReducingBall
  * WelzlEncloser2DTest.testLargeSamples
  * WelzlEncloser3DTest.testInfiniteLoop
  * WelzlEncloser3DTest.testLargeSamples
