BugID: MATH-942
Summary: DiscreteDistribution.sample(int) may throw an exception if first element
  of singletons of sub-class type
Description: |-
  Creating an array with {{Array.newInstance(singletons.get(0).getClass(), sampleSize)}} in DiscreteDistribution.sample(int) is risky. An exception will be thrown if:
  * {{singleons.get(0)}} is of type T1, an sub-class of T, and
  * {{DiscreteDistribution.sample()}} returns an object which is of type T, but not of type T1.

  To reproduce:
  {code}
  List<Pair<Object,Double>> list = new ArrayList<Pair<Object, Double>>();
  list.add(new Pair<Object, Double>(new Object() {}, new Double(0)));
  list.add(new Pair<Object, Double>(new Object() {}, new Double(1)));
  new DiscreteDistribution<Object>(list).sample(1);
  {code}

  Attaching a patch.
