BugID: MATH-554
Summary: Vector3D.crossProduct is sensitive to numerical cancellation
Description: |-
  Cross product implementation uses the naive formulas (y1 z2 - y2 z1, ...). These formulas fail when vectors are almost colinear, like in the following example:
  {code}
  Vector3D v1 = new Vector3D(9070467121.0, 4535233560.0, 1);
  Vector3D v2 = new Vector3D(9070467123.0, 4535233561.0, 1);
  System.out.println(Vector3D.crossProduct(v1, v2));
  {code}

  The previous code displays { -1, 2, 0 } instead of the correct answer { -1, 2, 1 }
