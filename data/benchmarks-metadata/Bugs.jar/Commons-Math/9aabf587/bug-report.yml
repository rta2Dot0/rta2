Summary: Use analytical function for UniformRealDistribution.inverseCumulativeProbability
Description: |-
  The inverse CDF is currently solved by a root finding function. It would be much simpler (and faster) to use the analytical expression. This would save the user from having to set the inverseCumAccuracy correctly.

  I've attached a patch that implements this.
