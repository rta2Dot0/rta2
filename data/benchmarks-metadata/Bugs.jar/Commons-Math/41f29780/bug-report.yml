BugID: MATH-1256
Summary: Interval class upper and lower check
Description: |+
  In class Interval, which is in the package org.apache.commons.math4.geometry.euclidean.oned it is possible to pass the value for variable upper  less than the value of variable lower, which is logically incorrect and  also causes the method getSize() to return negative value.

  For example:

   @Test
    public void test1()  throws Throwable  {
        Interval interval0 = new Interval(0.0, (-1.0));
        double double0 = interval0.getSize();
        assertEquals((-1.0), double0, 0.01D);
    }
