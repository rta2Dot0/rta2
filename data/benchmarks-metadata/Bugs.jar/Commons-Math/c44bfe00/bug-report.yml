Summary: Exception thrown in ode for a pair of close events
Description: |-
  When two discrete events occur closer to each other than the convergence threshold used for locating them, this sometimes triggers a NumberIsTooLargeException.

  The exception happens because the EventState class think the second event is simply a numerical artifact (a repetition of the already triggerred first event) and tries to skip past it. If there are no other event in the same step later on, one interval boundary finally reach step end and the interval bounds are reversed.
