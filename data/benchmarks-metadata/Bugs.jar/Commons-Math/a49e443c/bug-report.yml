Summary: Not expected UnboundedSolutionException
Description: "SimplexSolver throws UnboundedSolutionException when trying to solve
  minimization linear programming problem. The number of exception thrown depends
  on the number of variables.\n\nIn order to see that behavior of SimplexSolver first
  try to run JUnit test setting a final variable ENTITIES_COUNT = 2 and that will
  give almost good result and then set it to 15 and you'll get a massive of unbounded
  exceptions.\nFirst iteration is runned with predefined set of input data with which
  the Solver gives back an appropriate result.\n\nThe problem itself is well tested
  by it's authors (mathematicians who I believe know what they developed) using Matlab
  10 with no unbounded solutions on the same rules of creatnig random variables values.\n\nWhat
  is strange to me is the dependence of the number of UnboundedSolutionException exceptions
  on the number of variables in the problem.\n\nThe problem is formulated as\nmin(1*t
  + 0*L) (for every r-th subject)\ns.t.\n-q(r) + QL >= 0\nx(r)t - XL >= 0\nL >= 0\nwhere
  \nr = 1..R, \nL = {l(1), l(2), ..., l(R)} (vector of R rows and 1 column),\nQ -
  coefficients matrix MxR\nX - coefficients matrix NxR "
