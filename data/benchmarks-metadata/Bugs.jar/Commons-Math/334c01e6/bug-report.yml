BugID: MATH-631
Summary: '"RegulaFalsiSolver" failure'
Description: |
  The following unit test:
  {code}
  @Test
  public void testBug() {
      final UnivariateRealFunction f = new UnivariateRealFunction() {
              @Override
              public double value(double x) {
                  return Math.exp(x) - Math.pow(Math.PI, 3.0);
              }
          };

      UnivariateRealSolver solver = new RegulaFalsiSolver();
      double root = solver.solve(100, f, 1, 10);
  }
  {code}
  fails with
  {noformat}
  illegal state: maximal count (100) exceeded: evaluations
  {noformat}

  Using "PegasusSolver", the answer is found after 17 evaluations.
