BugID: MATH-939
Summary: stat.correlation.Covariance should allow one-column matrices
Description: Currently (rev 1453206), passing 1-by-M matrix to the Covariance constructor
  throws IllegalArgumentException. For consistency, the Covariance class should work
  for a single-column matrix (i.e., for a N-dimensional random variable with N=1)
  and it should return 1-by-1 covariance matrix with the variable's variance in its
  only element.
