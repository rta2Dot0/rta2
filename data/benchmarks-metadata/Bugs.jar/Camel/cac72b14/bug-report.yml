BugID: CAMEL-8053
Summary: Memory leak when adding/removing a lot of routes
Description: Dynamically adding/removing routes to camel causes registrations in org.apache.camel.builder.ErrorHandlerBuilderRef.handlers
  (Map<RouteContext, ErrorHandlerBuilder>) for RouteContext instances. Those never
  get removed and can cause leaks if memory consuming objects are attached in the
  RouteContext for example constant definitions.
