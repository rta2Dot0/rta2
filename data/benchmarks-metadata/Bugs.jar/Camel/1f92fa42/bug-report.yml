Summary: 'NotCompliantMBeanException : Attribute MessageHistory has more than one
  getter'
Description: |-
  Hello, I wasn't able to subscribe on the mailing list, so I'm posting my issue directly here.

  In my project I need to use some _ManagedCamelContextMBean_, which I am trying to access through [JMX.newMBeanProxy|http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/management/JMX.html#newMBeanProxy-javax.management.MBeanServerConnection-javax.management.ObjectName-java.lang.Class-]

  However, it is not working as I'm getting a *NotCompliantMBeanException* because the attribute _MessageHistory_ is said to have more than one getter.

  I checked the source code of newMBeanProxy, then the [JMX 1.4 specification|http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jmx/JMX_1_4_specification.pdf], and then Camel's source code, and it appears that ManagedCamelContextMBean is indeed not respecting the standard MBean.

  The problem is that two methods are defined in _ManagedCamelContextMBean_ : isMessageHistory() and getMessageHistory()
  Since the return type is boolean, isMessageHistory is considered to be a getter, which makes two getter according to the JMX specification and is blocking the newMBeanProxy() method.
