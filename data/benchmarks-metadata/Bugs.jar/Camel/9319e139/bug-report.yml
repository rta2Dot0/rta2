BugID: CAMEL-3789
Summary: org.apache.camel.component.file.strategy.MarkerFileExclusiveReadLockStrategy
  is not thread-safe
Description: "MarkerFileExclusiveReadLockStrategy is not thread-safe. When I run  a
  File endpoint with more than one thread the MarkerFileExclusiveReadLockStrategy
  only deletes the last file to start being processed. \n\nThe MarkerFileExclusiveReadLockStrategy
  uses global variables: \nprivate File lock; \nprivate String lockFileName; \nand
  gives them values on the acquireExclusiveReadLock method. When another thread calls
  the releaseExclusiveReadLock method it uses the global variables to delete the locked
  file. That means that if another thread came and called the acquireExclusiveReadLock
  it would have changed the values on the global variables. \n\nIf lock and lockFileName
  are not global variables the problem seems to disappear and I can a multithreaded
  File endpoint and not locked file is left undeleted. \n"
