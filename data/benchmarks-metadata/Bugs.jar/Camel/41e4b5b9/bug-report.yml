Summary: scala - xpath not working together with choice/when
Description: "When using the Scala DSL, xpath expressions inside when() do not work
  as expected. As an example:\n{code:none}\n     \"direct:a\" ==> {\n     choice {\n
  \       when (xpath(\"//hello\")) to (\"mock:english\")\n        when (xpath(\"//hallo\"))
  {\n          to (\"mock:dutch\")\n          to (\"mock:german\")\n        } \n        otherwise
  to (\"mock:french\")\n      }\n    }\n\n// Send messages\n\"direct:a\" ! (\"<hello/>\",
  \"<hallo/>\", \"<hellos/>\")\n{code}\n\nHere we should receive 1 message in each
  of the mocks. For whatever reason, all 3 messages go to mock:english. Similar routes
  work as expected with the Java DSL. "
