BugID: CAMEL-3727
Summary: Recipient list with parallel processing doesn't reuse aggregation threads
Description: |
  When I'm using recipient list in parallel mode {{aggregateExecutorService}} in {{MulticastProcessor}} doesn't reuse threads and is creating one new thread per each request.

  To reproduce this bug simply add a loop to {{RecipientListParallelTest.testRecipientListParallel()}} test:
  {code:title=RecipientListParallelTest.java|borderStyle=solid}
      public void testRecipientListParallel() throws Exception {
          for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
              MockEndpoint mock = getMockEndpoint("mock:result");
              mock.reset();
              mock.expectedBodiesReceivedInAnyOrder("c", "b", "a");
              template.sendBodyAndHeader("direct:start", "Hello World", "foo", "direct:a,direct:b,direct:c");
              assertMockEndpointsSatisfied();
          }
      }
  {code}

  In the logs you can find:
