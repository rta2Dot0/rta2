BugID: CAMEL-9672
Summary: ClassCastException with interceptFrom
Description: |-
  If a statement like

  {code:java}
  interceptFrom().when(simple("${header.foo} == 'bar'")).to("mock:intercepted");
  {code}

  is available in a route builder with JMX enabled the startup will fail in Camel 2.16.2 (and the current 2.17-SNAPSHOT) with a ClassCastException in line 310 of DefaultManagementObjectStrategy.

  The generated processor is a FilterProcessor, but the resulting definition is a WhenDefinition not a FilterDefinition.

  The reason is that CAMEL-8992 introduced a too precise class check for this.

  The attached patch relexes the class constraint on the definition.
