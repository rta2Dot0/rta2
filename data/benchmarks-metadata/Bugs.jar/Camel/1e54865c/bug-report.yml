BugID: CAMEL-4682
Summary: When stopping CamelContext should not clear lifecycleStrategies, to make
  restart safely possible
Description: We should not clear the lifecycleStrategies on CamelContext when stop()
  is invoked, as if we restart by invoking start(), the lifecycle strategies should
  be in use again.
