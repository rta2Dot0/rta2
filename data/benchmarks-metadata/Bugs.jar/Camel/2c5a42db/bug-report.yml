Summary: AbstractListAggregationStrategy does not work with batch completion strategy
Description: |-
  When my aggregator extends AbstractListAggregationStrategy, I never get aggregator completions from the batch consumer.

  If I change my aggregator to be something like:

  {code}
      Foo foo = newExchange.getIn().getBody(Foo.class);
      List<Foo> list = null;
      Exchange outExchange;
      if (oldExchange == null) {
        list = new LinkedList<Foo>();
        list.add(foo);
        newExchange.getIn().setBody(list);
        outExchange = newExchange;
      } else {
        list = oldExchange.getIn().getBody(List.class);
        list.add(foo);
        outExchange = oldExchange;
      }
      return outExchange;
  {code}

  then it works fine.

  I'm guessing this is has something to do with AbstractListAggregationStrategy messing with properties or wrapping the actual exchanges (since the batch completion is triggered based on Exchange.BATCH_SIZE property)
