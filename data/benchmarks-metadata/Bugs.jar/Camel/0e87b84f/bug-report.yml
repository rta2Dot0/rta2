BugID: CAMEL-5571
Summary: Camel proxies should not forward hashCode() method invocations
Description: |
  Given a Camel proxy for an @InOnly service interface, and a route from the proxy to a JMS endpoint, calling hashCode() on the proxy throws an exception, either immediately or after a number of retries, depending on the route configuration.

  See the attached test case for different scenarios.

  The reason is that hashCode() is forwarded by the CamelInvocationHandler to the remote endpoint, which does not make sense in this case.
