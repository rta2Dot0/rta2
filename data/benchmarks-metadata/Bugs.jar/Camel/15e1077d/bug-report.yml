BugID: CAMEL-7055
Summary: NullPointerException at FileInputStreamCache.<init>(FileInputStreamCache.java:52)
  in connection with DataFormat.marshal
Description: "Stack Trace:\n{code}\nCaused by: java.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat
  org.apache.camel.converter.stream.FileInputStreamCache.<init>(FileInputStreamCache.java:52)\n\tat
  org.apache.camel.converter.stream.CachedOutputStream.newStreamCache(CachedOutputStream.java:199)\n\tat
  org.apache.camel.processor.MarshalProcessor.process(MarshalProcessor.java:79)\n{code}\n\nError
  occurs, if streamCache is true and the stream is put into the file system because
  the spool threashold is reached. \n\nThe following is happening:\nThe Marshall Processor
  handels over to the DataFromat.marshal method a CachedOutputStream instance. In
  the marschal method data are written into the output stream, when the spool threshold
  is reached the data are streamed into the file system. Finally the output stream
  is closed and the CachedOutputStream instance deletes the cached file during closing.
  The next processor tries to read the FileInputStreamCache and gets the NullPointerException.\n\nCurrently
  this problem can occur in the following DataFormat classes (because they close the
  stream, which is actually correct):\n\nGzipDataFormat\nCryptoDataFormat\nPGPDataFormat\nSerializationDataFormat\nXMLSecurityDataFormat\nZipDataFormat\n\nMy
  proposal is not to delete the cached file during closing the output stream. The
  cached file shall only be closed on the onCompletion event of the route. See attached
  patch.\n\n\n"
