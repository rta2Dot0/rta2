Summary: JpaMessageIdRepository uses EntityManager non thread-safe
Description: |-
  In our product we have found strange behavior of JpaMessageIdRepository when change version 2.9.2 to 2.12.3.
  The reason for this was that EntityManager assigned in the constructor org.apache.camel.processor.idempotent.jpa.JpaMessageIdRepository, but
  EntityManager not required to be thread safe.

  I think need assign the EntityManager in each method separately.
