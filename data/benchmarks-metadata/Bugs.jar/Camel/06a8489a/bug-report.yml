BugID: CAMEL-4474
Summary: 'file: consumer does not create directory'
Description: "According to http://camel.apache.org/file2.html autoCreate is true by
  default and should for a consumer create the directory.\n{noformat}\nautoCreate
  \ttrue \tAutomatically create missing directories in the file's pathname. For the
  file consumer, that means creating the starting directory. For the file producer,
  it means the directory the files should be written to. \n{noformat}\nThis does not
  happen and thus a route startup would fail."
