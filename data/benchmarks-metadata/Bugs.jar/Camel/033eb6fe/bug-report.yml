BugID: CAMEL-5215
Summary: The file producer should use the charset encoding when writing the file if
  configured
Description: |-
  When writing to a file, we offer the charset option on the endpoint, as well the charset property set on the exchange.
  However in a route  that is optimized as
  {code}
  from file
   to file
  {code}

  Then we optimize to do a file move operation instead. We should detect the charset configured and then we would need to stream and write using the configured charset.
