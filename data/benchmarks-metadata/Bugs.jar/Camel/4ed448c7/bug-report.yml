Summary: JMX - Update route from xml on route mbean should update current route only
Description: |-
  If you do not have id of the route in the XML then Camel thinks its a new route to be added. We should ensure we handle that, and only update current route as that is the intend of this operation.

  If you want to add new routes use mbean operation on camelcontext instead.
