BugID: CAMEL-7163
Summary: BacklogDebugger - Should not change body/header type to string
Description: |-
  When using the backlog debugger then updating the body/headers would currently force those to become string type.

  We should preserve existing type, and allow end users to specify a new type. And also make it possible to remove body/headers as well.
