BugID: CAMEL-6667
Summary: Loop EIP doesn't honour copy option in some circumstances
Description: "Happens when the Async Routing Engine variant of the Loop logic kicks
  in, and there are more than two processors in the loop body, e.g. \n\\\\\n\\\\\n{code:java}\n.loop(3)\n
  \ .to(\"activemq:queue:abc?exchangePattern=InOut\")\n  .to(\"activemq:queue:def?exchangePattern=InOut\")\n.end()\n{code}\n\nThe
  wrong inflight Exchange is copied (instead of the original one), and since the implicit
  Pipeline has copied the OUT message from the 1st endpoint to the IN message, the
  original IN message is lost fully."
