BugID: CAMEL-7448
Summary: throttle EIP - unchanged value
Description: |
  Throttler Documentation [1] states "If the header is absent, then the Throttler uses the old value. So that allows you to only provide a header if the  value is to be changed".

  however if the expression evaluates to null (header missing from message) the Throttler throws an exception (Throttler.java:108).

  The workaround is to ensure that all messages carry the value (if the value is the same no changes will take affect). Adding an option to turn this on and off (e.g. allowNullException) would make it much easier to use (as per camel-users thread [2]).
