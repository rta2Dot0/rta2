BugID: CAMEL-6948
Summary: ProducerCache should not only stop non-singelton Producers but also shutdown
  them afterwards as well if the given Producer is a ShutdownableService
Description: |-
  Currently because of this bug the {{doShutdown}} hook of the following non-singleton Producers doesn't kick in at all:

  - {{JpaProducer}}
  - {{Mina2Producer}}

  Which could cause resources leaking.
