BugID: CAMEL-3757
Summary: Auto mock endpoints should strip parameters to avoid confusing when accessing
  the mocked endpoint
Description: |-
  If you use mocking existing endpoints, which is detailed here
  http://camel.apache.org/mock.html

  We should stip parameters of the mocked endpoint, eg {{file:xxxx?noop=true}}. eg so the mocked endpoint would be {{mock:file:xxxx}} without any of the parameters.

  Otherwise the mock endpoint expects those parameters is part of the mock endpoint and will fail creating the mock endpoint.
