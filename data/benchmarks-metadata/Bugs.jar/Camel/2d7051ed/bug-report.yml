BugID: CAMEL-6607
Summary: Tokenize XML does not support child elements with names similar to their
  parent
Description: |-
  This XML will not split on Trip, as Trip has a child which starts with Trip
  <Trip>
  <Triptype>
  </Triptype>
  </Trip>

  The bug was introduced in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-6004
  I believe the regex in TokenXMLExpressionIterator needs to be fixed

  see enclosed test
