BugID: CAMEL-9673
Summary: doTry .. doFinally should run the finally block for fault messages also
Description: If a message has fault flag, then a doFinally block is only executed
  the first processor. We should ensure the entire block is processed like we do if
  an exception was thrown. The same kind of logic should apply for fault.
