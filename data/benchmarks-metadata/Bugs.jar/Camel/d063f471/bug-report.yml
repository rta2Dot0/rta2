BugID: CAMEL-8626
Summary: Leaking exchangesInFlightKeys in ManagedRoute
Description: |
  Having a camel context with a single route:
  {code}
          onException(Throwable.class)
                  .handled(true)
                  .process(handleException()); // essentially  doing exchange.setException(someConvertedException);

          from("direct:generalFlow")
                  .routingSlip(property(GeneralFlowRoute.class.getName()));
  {code}

  started from Spring:
  {code}
      <camelContext id="flows" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
          <template id="template" defaultEndpoint="direct:generalFlow"/>
          <routeBuilder ref="generalFlow"/>
      </camelContext>

      <bean id="generalFlow" class="com.blabla.GeneralFlowRoute"/>
  {code}

  During performance test both exchangesInFlightKeys  and exchangesInFlightStartTimestamps are accumulating over time.

  But if the test is run in one thread with debug - nothing is accumulated.

  Issue found after migration from 2.14.1 to 2.15.1
