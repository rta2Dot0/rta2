BugID: CAMEL-6687
Summary: Using simple language OGNL expressions doesn't work for Bean Binding when
  a field is null
Description: "The following functionality doesn't work, when one of the fields is
  null: \n\nhttp://camel.apache.org/bean-binding.html\n{quote}\nYou can also use the
  OGNL support of the Simple expression language. Now suppose the message body is
  an object which has a method named asXml. To invoke the asXml method we can do as
  follows:\n{code}.bean(OrderService.class, \"doSomething(${body.asXml}, ${header.high})\"){code}\n\nInstead
  of using .bean as shown in the examples above, you may want to use .to instead as
  shown:\n{code}.to(\"bean:orderService?method=doSomething(${body.asXml}, ${header.high})\"){code}\n{quote}\n\nA
  test case is provided. Instead of getting values of fields \"foo\" and \"bar\" respectively,
  the first parameter (which should be null) receives value of pojo.toString(), while
  the second parameter receives the correct value."
