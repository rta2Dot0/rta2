BugID: CAMEL-3448
Summary: Route scoped onException may pick onException from another route if they
  are the same class type
Description: |
  If you have a clash with route scoped onException and have the exact same class, then the key in the map isn't catering for this. And thus a 2nd route could override the 1st route onException definition.

  For example:

  from X route A
    onException IOException

  from Y route B
    onException IOException

  The map should contain 2 entries, but unfortunately it only contain 1. This only happens when its an exact type match.
