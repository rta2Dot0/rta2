BugID: CAMEL-3878
Summary: Stopping a route should not stop context scoped error handler
Description: |-
  When stopping a route using .stopRoute from CamelContext or JMX etc. then the error handler should not be stopped if its a context scoped error handler, as it would be re-used.

  We should defer stopping those resources till Camel is shutting down.
