BugID: CAMEL-3281
Summary: RouteBuilder - Let if fail if end user is configuring onException etc after
  routes
Description: |-
  All such cross cutting concerns must be defined before routes.

  We should throw an exception if end user has configured them after routes, which is currently not supported in the DSL.
