BugID: CAMEL-9666
Summary: 'Safe copy of DefaultExchange does not propagate ''fault'' property '
Description: |-
  {{fault}} property should be copied in the following places:

  https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/impl/DefaultExchange.java#L100
  https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/impl/DefaultExchange.java#L107

  Consequences:
  {{DefaultExchange#isFault()}} does not work if {{exception}} property is not set.
