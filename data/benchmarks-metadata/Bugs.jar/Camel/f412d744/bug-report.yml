Summary: 'StaxConverter: encoding problems for XMLEventReader and XMLStreamReader'
Description: |-
  StaxConverter creates XMLEventReader and XMLStreamReader always with a specified encoding. However, the encoding of the data the readers should read is not always known. Therefore exceptions occur.

  The solution is easy: The encoding should not be set so that the readers can determine the encoding.
