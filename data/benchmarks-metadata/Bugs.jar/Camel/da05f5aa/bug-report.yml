Summary: Add support for batch consumer's empty messages to aggregator
Description: |-
  Aggregator supports completion based on the batch consumer data (option completionFromBatchConsumer)

  Some batch consumers (eg. File) can send an empty message if there is no input (option sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle for File consumer).

  Aggregator is unable to handle such messages properly - the messages are aggregated, but Aggregator never completes.


  Here is the relevant fragment from AggregateProcessor.isCompleted(String,
  Exchange)

  int size = exchange.getProperty(Exchange.BATCH_SIZE, 0, Integer.class);
  if (size > 0 && batchConsumerCounter.intValue() >= size) {
      ....
  }


  Please add support for this combination of options.
