BugID: CAMEL-7736
Summary: Failure to create producer during routing slip or similar eip causes exchange
  causes error handler not to react properly
Description: |-
  If an endpoint.createProducer throws an exception from a dynamic eip, then the exchange is kept marked as inflight, and the error handler does not react asap and as expected.

  This was working in Camel 2.10.x etc.
