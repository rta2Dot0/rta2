Summary: Using @Simple (or others) bean parameter binding for boolean type should
  eval as predicate
Description: |-
  For example
  {code}
          public void read(String body, @Simple("${header.foo} != null") boolean foo) {
  {code}

  The foo parameter is a boolean and thus the @Simple expression should be evaluated as a predicate and not as an Expression which happens today.
