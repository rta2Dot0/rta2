BugID: CAMEL-7359
Summary: Simple Language - Additional after text after inbuilt function call is ignored
Description: |-
  The following Simple expression is valid and runs OK - however it may have been appropriate to report an error to the developer.

  {code:xml}
              <setBody>
                  <simple>${bodyAs(java.lang.String) Additional text ignored...}</simple>
              </setBody>
  {code}

  The above seems a somewhat contrived example; However this is a more 'realistic' scenario in which the behaviour is not unexpected -

  {code:xml}
              <setBody>
                  <simple>${bodyAs(java.lang.String).toUpperCase()}</simple>
              </setBody>
  {code}

  The above simple expression will simply set the body to be of type java.lang.String, however will not invoke the subsequent toUpperCase() call - likewise no error is reported to the developer.

  Camel has the same issue when using the function of headerAs and mandatoryBodyAs.
