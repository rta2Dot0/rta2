BugID: CAMEL-3388
Summary: "@OutHeaders in bean binding issue with InOnly MEP"
Description: |-
  When you invoke a bean with a method signature like this in Camel 2.5.0/HEAD, the in and out message both are null (the "Hello!" value just disappears):

  {code:java}
      public String doTest(@Body Object body, @Headers Map headers, @OutHeaders Map outHeaders) {
          return "Hello!";
      }
  {code}

  The same thing without the headers works OK:

  {code:java}
      public String doTest(@Body Object body) {
          return "Hello!";
      }
  {code}
  See camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/component/bean/BeanWithHeadersAndBodyInject3Test.java
