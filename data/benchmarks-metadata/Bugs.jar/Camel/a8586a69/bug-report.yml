BugID: CAMEL-5154
Summary: Simple language - OGNL - Invoking explicit method with no parameters should
  not cause ambiguous exception for overloaded methods
Description: |
  If you want to invoke a method on a bean which is overloaded, such as a String with toUpperCase having
  - toUpperCase()
  - toUpperCase(Locale)

  Then if you specify this in a simple ognl expression as follows
  {code}
  ${body.toUpperCase()}
  {code}

  Then Camel bean component should pick the no-parameter method as specified.
