BugID: CAMEL-7883
Summary: XSD decoding bad guess in Validator
Description: 'Validator component does not take imported XSD encoding into account
  when validating XML. That may lead to validation errors if an imported XSD is ISO-8859-1
  encoded and containing non ASCII caracters, even though that XSD declares its encoding
  correctly in its XML prolog.
