BugID: CAMEL-5224
Summary: The done file got deleted, when using the file component even if noop property
  set to true
Description: |
  We are consuming a feed from a mounted windows network drive, where we have rw access.
  During the download we shouldn't touch anything so other users see the directory intact.

  However even if we turn noop=true the done file got deleted after successfull conumptions
