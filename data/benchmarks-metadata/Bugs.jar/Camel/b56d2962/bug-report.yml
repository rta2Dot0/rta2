BugID: CAMEL-3535
Summary: Aggregation fails to call onComplete for exchanges if the aggregation is
  after a bean or process.
Description: |-
  When creating a route that contains an aggregation, if that aggregation is preceded by a bean or process, it will fail to call AggregateOnCompletion.onComplete(). I've attached a unit test that can show you the behavior. Trace level loggging will need to be enabled to see the difference. With the call to the bean, it won't show the following log entry:
  {noformat}TRACE org.apache.camel.processor.aggregate.AggregateProcessor - Aggregated exchange onComplete: Exchange[Message: ab]{noformat}
  If you remove the bean call, it'll start calling onComplete() again.

  What I've noticed is that if this call is not made, it ends up in a memory leak since the inProgressCompleteExchanges HashSet in AggregateProcessor never has any exchange ID's removed.
