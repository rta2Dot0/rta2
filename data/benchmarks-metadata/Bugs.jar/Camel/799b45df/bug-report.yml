Summary: CircuitBreakerLoadBalancer fails on async processors
Description: "The CircuitBreakerLoadBalancer works fine on direct synchronous processor,
  but it seems to not behave as expected in case of async processor.\n\nTo reproduce
  the error, it's enough to add a .threads(1) before the mock processor in the CircuitBreakerLoadBalancerTest
  routeBuilder configuration.\n\nThis misbehaviour seems to be related to the use
  of the AsyncProcessorConverterHelper to force any processor to behave like asynchronous.
  \n\nI'm going to propose a patch with the failing test and a proposal of solution.\n\nEDIT:\n\nthe
  patch contains the fix also to other unexpected behaviour of the CircuitBreaker.\n\nThe
  second problem addressed is that, after the opening of the circuit, the RejectedExecutionException
  raised by the circuit breaker is set in the Exchange, but it doesn't return. This
  cause the processor will receive the Exchange even if the circuit is open. In this
  case also, if the CircuitBreaker is instructed to react only to specific Exception,
  it will close the circuit after the following request, because the raised exception
  would be a RejectedExecutionException instead of the one specified in the configuration."
