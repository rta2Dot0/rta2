BugID: CAMEL-7344
Summary: Some endpoints configured using beans may result in NPE under DEBUG mode
Description: |-
  CAMEL-6130 seems to have introduced this issue or more precisely speaking, it has made this issue visible.

  DefaultEndpoint's toString() method seems to require its endpoint string value to be set. If it's not set, the toString method throws an exception. A fully built endpoint always has its endpoint string value set, thus there is no issue. However, an endpoint being manually set up may not have its endpoint string value set from the beginning (e.g., when its super class uses the DefaultEndpoint's default constructor to instantiate using a bean based instantiation).

  The debug log statement introduced in CAMEL-6130 invokes this toString method during the endpoint setup.

  That means, a spring based CXF endpoint may result in the following exception under the debug mode.

  SLF4J: Failed toString() invocation on an object of type [org.apache.camel.component.cxf.CxfSpringEndpoint]
  java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: endpointUri is not specified and org.apache.camel.component.cxf.CxfSpringEndpoint does not implement createEndpointUri() to create a default value

  I  wonder whether we really need DefaultEndpoint's getEndpointUri() to throw an exception when it's endpoint string value is not set. But if we keep this rule, we must catch the exception in its toString() method so that we won't throw the above exception when the toString() method is called during the endpoint setup

  I would propose to add the exception catching in the toString method. If we decide to change the getEndpointUri() method to not throw the exception (that change will likely require the NPE check at the users of this method), we can make that change and remove the exception catch from the toString method

  This issue affects camel 2.11.0 and later versions.
