BugID: CAMEL-8584
Summary: Circuit breaker does not honour halfOpenAfter period
Description: |-
  The CircuitBreakerLoadBalancer will always switch to a half-open state immediately after the first rejected message instead of honouring the halfOpenAfter period.

  It's due to the failed message count getting reset in the rejectExchange method:
