BugID: CAMEL-7611
Summary: org.apache.camel.util.KeyValueHolder equals bug
Description: "According to java.lang.Object javadoc (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html),
  \"equal objects must have equal hash codes\". \n\nCurrent implementation of the
  \"equals\" and \"hashCode\" method of the org.apache.camel.util.KeyValueHolder does
  not seem to follow that rule: hashCode is calculated from the key and value attributes
  while the equals compares only the key attribute. \n\nCould generate unexpected
  behaviour in certain circumstances."
