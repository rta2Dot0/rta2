BugID: CAMEL-5357
Summary: URI normalization - Should detect already percent encoded values
Description: |-
  If an uri has a percent encoded value, eg using %20, %25 etc, then the normalization logic in Camel should detect this and keep the value as is.

  Currently it would end up double encoding %25, that becomes %2525, and so forth.

  Its the code in UnsafeUriCharactersEncoder that has the bug
