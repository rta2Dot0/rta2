BugID: CAMEL-5796
Summary: The combination of the transacted DSL together with the <setHeader> or <setBody>
  prohibits to resolve the properties properly.
Description: |
  Given the property {{myKey}} defined as:
  {code}
  myKey=myValue
  {code}

  Then consider the following trivial route:
  {code:xml}
  <route>
    <from uri="activemq:queue:okay" />
      <transacted />
      <setHeader headerName="myHeader">
        <constant>{{myKey}}</constant>
      </setHeader>
    <to uri="mock:test" />
  </route>
  {code}

  Because of the usage of the {{transacted}} DSL the property placeholder {{{{myKey}}}} will not be resolved to {{myValue}} properly. This behaviour would disappear if you would remove the {{transacted}} DSL. And I'm observing the same behaviour using the {{setBody}} DSL as well.
