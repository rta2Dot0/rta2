BugID: LOG4J2-268
Summary: Berkeley (persistent) agent for FlumeAppender only works with MapMessages
  (and thus not slf4j)
Description: "If I try and use the persistent FlumeAppender with slf4j then I get
  a NullPointerException in FlumePersistentManager.send because there is no GUID header.\n\n(My
  repro here was using a copy of Flume modified to use log4j2 - while this particular
  repro is exotic I'm confident that the general case detailed above will be very
  common).\n\nThere is no GUID header because the FlumeEvent constructor only creates
  one if the message is a MapMessage.\n\nIf the user is using slf4j then all messages
  are PersistentMessages - and thus will cause this logging to fail.\n\nThe GUID is
  required because it's used as a key in the BerkeleyDB storage.\n\nMy attempts at
  a simple fix ran afoul of the key lookup from the headers in FlumePersisentManager.WriterThread.run(). "
