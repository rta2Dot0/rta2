BugID: LOG4J2-102
Summary: Bad priority in Syslog messages
Description: |-
  In class org.apache.logging.log4j.core.net.Priority the method getPriority returns a bad priority when used for Syslog messages (the only usage at the moment). The bug is in the statement:

  facility.getCode() << 3 + Severity.getSeverity(level).getCode()

  That's because the operator "+" takes precedence over "<<", and so the facility code isn't shifted by 3 but by "3 + Severity.getSeverity(level).getCode()".
