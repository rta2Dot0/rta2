BugID: LOG4J2-310
Summary: SMTPAppender does not send mails with error or fatal level without prior
  info event
Description: |-
  When using an SMTPAppender a mail is only delivered on a fatal event if there occured an info event before.
  Prior fatal events are ignored by SMTPAppender - other Appenders log them.
