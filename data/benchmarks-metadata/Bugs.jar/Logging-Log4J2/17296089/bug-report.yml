Summary: ThreadContextMapFilter doesn't match properly when a single keyvalue is provided
Description: |+
  I was testing out a global ThreadContextMapFilter and noticed it wasn't matching properly.  I took a closer look at the code and found because it wasn't matching the value to the value on the context but rather the key.

  I changed it to use the value as the argument to equals and this fixed it.  Here is the diff of what I am running with.
