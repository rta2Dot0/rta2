BugID: LOG4J2-466
Summary: Cannot load log4j2 config file if path contains plus '+' characters
Description: "Hello,\n\nI was trying to programmatically load a XML config file from
  the temporary data directory of a MacOS X system. The temp path consists of serveral
  '\\+' characters like MacOS automatically generates this path so we have to take
  it this way. Even I would agree that it is not nice to have '\\+' chars in a path
  name.\n\nWhen I tried to load the XML config the framework permanently loaded the
  DefaultConfig and not the desired XML configuration.\nBy stepping through the debugger
  I figured out that this was caused by the method fileFromURI() in org.apache.logging.log4j.core.helpers.FileUtils.java
  .\nThe misbehaviour was basically caused by the call of URL.decode() which converts
  '+' to ' ' (space) of a given String. \nNow I self-compiled the whole framework
  without the call of URL.decode() and the XML configuration loaded properly. \nI
  can not see why this call is necessary in this method so in my opinion this should
  be removed.\n\n\nKind regards"
