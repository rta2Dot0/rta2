BugID: LOG4J2-668
Summary: AsyncAppender ignores RingBufferLogEvents from AsyncLoggers (when all loggers
  async by setting context selector)
Description: |-
  AsyncAppender's #append method currently has this code:
  {code}
  if (!(logEvent instanceof Log4jLogEvent)) {
      return; // only know how to Serialize Log4jLogEvents
  }
  {code}

  When all loggers are made asynchronous by setting Log4jContextSelector to {{org.apache.logging.log4j.core.async.AsyncLoggerContextSelector}}, they produce {{RingBufferLogEvent}} instances, not {{Log4jLogEvent}}. These log events will be dropped by AsyncAppender.
