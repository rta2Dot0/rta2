BugID: LOG4J2-447
Summary: XMLLayout does not include marker name
Description: |-
  Log4j2 supports the notion of markers, but this is not represented by the XMLLayout.

  For example, using SerializedLayout with SocketAppender will send marker information, but using XMLLayout with SocketAppender will not.

  It would be very helpful to have just the name of the leaf marker sent with the log event, not the corresponding marker hierarchy.
