BugID: LOG4J2-378
Summary: Logging generates file named ${sys on some systems
Description: "In a webapp I'm setting a system property in my apps ServletContextListener,
  and using that system property in my log4j2.xml file, like so:\n{code}\n<appender
  type=\"FastFile\" name=\"File\" fileName=\"${sys:catalina.home}/logs/${sys:application-name}.log\">\n{code}\nOn
  my Windows machine, a log file named \"${sys.\" (always 0 bytes) is being created
  instead of a log file with the application-name. The same war deployed on one of
  our linux servers does not create a ${sys.\" file and instead creates a log file
  with the intended application-name. \n\nI should note that the files DO appear in
  the directory that sys:catalina.home should resolve to. They appear elsewhere when
  I don't use sys:catalina.home so I'm quite sure that this variable is resolving
  correctly and it is the sys:application-name which is the problem.\n"
