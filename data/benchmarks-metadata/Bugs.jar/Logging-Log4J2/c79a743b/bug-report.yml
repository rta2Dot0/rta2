BugID: LOG4J2-101
Summary: Attribute "format" for SyslogAppender is mandatory
Description: |-
  In the SyslogAppender the configuration attribute "Format" must be present, otherwise a NullPointerException is thrown in method "createAppender" when the following statement is executed:

  if (format.equalsIgnoreCase(RFC5424))

  The fix is simply to add a check so the "equalsIgnoreCase" is called only if the format variable isn't Null.
