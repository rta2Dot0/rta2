BugID: LOG4J2-293
Summary: classloader URI scheme broken or insufficient when using Log4jContextListener
Description: |-
  I'm trying to migrate to Log4j2, and things looked promising when I spotted Log4jContextListener.

  However, there are too many holes.

  Firstly, I tried using classpath: as a scheme, and nothing blew up, so I assumed I'd got it right.

  Then I *looked at the code* (which shouldn't be how we find out) and eventually discovered some code relating to a 'classloader' scheme.

  Still silent failure.  It seems that the classpath is not being searched, perhaps just the WAR classloader, not the JARs in WEB-INF/lib.

  Next I tried omitting the / (i.e. using classloader:log4j2.xml) and got a NullPointerException.

  Can you please document what schemes are supported and what you expect them to do, and *not fail silently* when a configuration file is specified, but nothing happens.
