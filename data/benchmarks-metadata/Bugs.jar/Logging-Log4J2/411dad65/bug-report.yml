BugID: LOG4J2-832
Summary: ThrowableProxy fails if a class in logged stack trace throws java.lang.Error
  from initializer
Description: "When the Logger attempts to log a message with an exception stack trace,
  it uses the ThrowableProxy class to introspect classes in the stack trace frames.\n\nIf
  the class sun.reflect.misc.Trampoline is in the stack trace, the introspection performed
  by ThrowableProxy will fail causing a java.lang.Error to be thrown by the Logger
  call.\n\nThe sun.reflect.misc.Trampoline class is used by the sun.reflect.misc.MethodUtil
  class to perform reflection-based method invocations. MethodUtil is widely used
  by libraries to perform method invocations. I've encountered this problem when invoking
  methods over JMX and inside Jetty.\n\nI am classifying this as a blocker because
  it means that any logging statement that is logging a Throwable message containing
  a MethodUtil-based reflection stack trace can cause a java.lang.Error to be thrown
  by Log4j2. \n\nI will attach a unit test for this failure."
