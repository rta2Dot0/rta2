BugID: LOG4J2-385
Summary: Unable to roll log files monthly
Description: Attempting to use FastRollingFile appender and configure log file rollover
  to occur monthly.  When {{filePattern="logs/app-%d\{yyyy-MM}.log.gz"}} is used,
  at application startup an archive file is created immediately (app-2013-01.log.gz)
  even if no log previously existed.  A log file is created, but only a single entry
  is made into the log.
