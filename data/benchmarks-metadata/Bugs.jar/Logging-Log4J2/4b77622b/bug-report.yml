BugID: LOG4J2-742
Summary: XInclude not working with relative path
Description: "When using XInclude in a log4j2 configuration, it uses the CWD of the
  running application instead of the location of the log4j configuration as base.\nI.e.
  running the application from within eclipse, the CWD of eclipse is used as base
  for finding the document to be included.\n\nIMO, the problem is in XmlConfiguration:\n{code}\n
  \           final InputStream configStream = configSource.getInputStream();\n            try
  {\n                buffer = toByteArray(configStream);\n            } finally {\n
  \               configStream.close();\n            }\n            final InputSource
  source = new InputSource(new ByteArrayInputStream(buffer));\n            final Document
  document = newDocumentBuilder().parse(source);\n{code}\nThere is no way the DOMParser
  can know, where the base should be, because it is just parsing an InputStream and
  has no file location. \n\nThe fix would be to add source.setSystemId(configSource.getLocation())
  before parsing the document."
