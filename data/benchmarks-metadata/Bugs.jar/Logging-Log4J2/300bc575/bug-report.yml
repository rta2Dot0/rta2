BugID: LOG4J2-302
Summary: NDCPatternConverter broken in beta7
Description: "After an upgrade from version 2.0-beta4 to beta7 the NDCPatternConverter
  writes an object-ID instead of the content of the NDC-stack. \n\nWe are using an
  pattern with \"[%0.50x]\". In beta4 the resulting output looks like \"[cbi@CE03178]\"
  which means username and machine. Now in beta7 it looks like \"[logging.log4j.spi.MutableThreadContextStack@875ef7]\".\n\nI
  analysed the issue in NDCPatternConverter.format(...) method, where event.getContextStack()
  is called and the result is passed to StringBuilder.append(...), which means, that
  the toString()-method will be invoked. \nIn beta4 getContextStack() returns an instance
  of ImmutableStack. This class inherits its toString() method from AbstractList,
  where the elements of the collection will be formatted human-readable. \nNow in
  beta7 there comes an instance of MutableThreadContextStack which isn't derived from
  AbstractList but implements the Collection-Interface. The toString() method comes
  from Object and returns the name of the class and an object-ID instead of the context
  of the unterlying stack/collection.\n\nIn my opinion you just need to copy or derive
  the toString() method from AbstractList to solve this issue. Thank you in advance!\n"
