BugID: LOG4J2-478
Summary: The message and ndc fields are not JavaScript escaped in JSONLayout
Description: The output of the JSONLayout includes the "message" field as is.  If
  there are any embedded newlines, quote, etc, this renders the JSON output as invalid.  To
  correct this, the "message" field should be properly JavaScript escaped.
