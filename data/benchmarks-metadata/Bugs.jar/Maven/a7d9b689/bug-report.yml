BugID: MNG-5003
Summary: MavenPluginManager serves m2e partially initialized mojo descriptors in some
  cases
Description: Not sure if this affect command line maven, but m2e sometimes gets MojoDescriptor
  instances with null classRealm and implementationClass. Looks like the problem has
  to do with incomplete plugin descriptor setup when after reused cached plugin realm.
  I'll try to provide a fix and corresponding unit test.
