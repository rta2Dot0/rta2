BugID: MNG-4648
Summary: NullPointerException thrown from DefaultPluginRealmCache#pluginHashCode method
  if project-level plugin dependency misses version
Description: |-
  As a user i would like to see better error reporting from DefaultPluginRealmCache#pluginHashCode method

  Currently it calculates hash value based on a dependency metadata, but if I omit version it fails with NullPointer exception.

  It would be more user friendly to validate metadata prior to calculating hash value and to display more meaningful error to the end user.

  Test scenario:
   - configure plugin and create dependencies
   - add dependency but DO NOT specify version
   - run maven such that plugin is invoked
  maven will fail without reporting which dependency doesn't have version
