Summary: update policy 'daily' not honored
Description: |-
  under certain circumstances, the '<updatePolicy>daily</updatePolicy>' isn't honored.

  This is the case where the remote metadata file doesn't exist, or contains <version>RELEASE/LATEST (which should never happen)..

  The timestamp used to compare for the update is 0L, because the local file doesn't exist.
  Then the remote file is retrieved, which also doesn't exist, and no metadatafile is created.
  The next time an up2date check is done, again against timestamp 0 for a non-existent file.

  This means that if you define a custom snapshot repo in settings.xml or a pom, and you have 500 transitive
  deps, the repo's that don't have that artifact are consulted 500 times for each mvn invocation.

  A build that normally takes about 20 seconds takes more than 10 minutes because of this bug.
