BugID: MNG-1797
Summary: Dependency excludes apply to every subsequent dependency, not just the one
  it is declared under.
Description: "If you specify ANY dependency excludes, all dependencies after that
  one in the pom will also exclude what you specified.  They appear to be cumulative
  on every dependency in that they bleed over into sibling dependencies.  \nIt's easy
  to test if you add an exclusion to a random dependency. This exclusion should exclude
  a required transitive dependency that is included by a dependency lower in the list.
  \ You will find that the dependency lower in the list no longer includes the required
  dependency because it is using the filter you declared in the other dependency.\n"
