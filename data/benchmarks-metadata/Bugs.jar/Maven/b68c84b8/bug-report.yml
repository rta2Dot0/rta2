BugID: MNG-1703
Summary: "<pluginManagement><dependencies> is not propagated to child POMs"
Description: |-
  <executions> section in <pluginManagement> isn't propagated to child POMs (as <configuration> is).
  The workaround is to use <plugins> with <inherited>true</inherited>
  Is this on purpose ?
