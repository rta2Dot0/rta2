BugID: MNG-1895
Summary: Dependencies in two paths are not added to resolution when scope needs to
  be updated in the nearest  due to any of nearest parents
Description: |
  scopes are not correctly calculated for this case

  my pom: a compile, b test
  a: c compile, d compile
  b: d compile

  then d ends in test scope because d is closer to my project through the path b-d

  I think scope importance should also be taken into account
