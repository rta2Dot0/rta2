BugID: MNG-4941
Summary: PluginDescriptorBuilder doesn't populate expression/default-value fields
  for mojo parameters
Description: As noted by Guo Du in his patch for MPH-81, the mojo descriptors created
  by the {{PluginDescriptorBuilder}} come out with parameter descriptors that always
  return null for the parameter expression and default value.
