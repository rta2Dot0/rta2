BugID: MNG-5212
Summary: DefaultPluginDescriptorCache does not retain pluginDescriptor dependencies
Description: PluginDescriptor dependencies is defined in META-INF/maven/plugin.xml,
  so there is no reason not to retain this field when storing and retrieving PluginDescriptor
  instances to and from descriptor cache. The attribute can be used in embedding scenarios
  and for command line builds to quickly determine if plugin has certain dependencies
  or not, without having to fully resolve plugin dependencies. I'll commit a fix with
  corresponding unit test shortly.
