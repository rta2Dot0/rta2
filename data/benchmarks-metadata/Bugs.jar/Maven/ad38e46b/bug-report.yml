BugID: MNG-1999
Summary: Reporting inheritance does not work properly
Description: |-
  I have a parent project and some subprojects. The parent project's pom has:

  <reporting>
     <excludeDefaults>true</excludeDefaults>
  </reporting>

  However, it does not get inherited to subprojects and so all default reports are generated for all subprojects.

  I'm not sure if this is a bug or a lack of feature but I would be good to have it.

  FYI, I'm speaking about here:
