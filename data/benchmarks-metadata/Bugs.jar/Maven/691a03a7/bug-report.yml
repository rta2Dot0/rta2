BugID: MNG-4918
Summary: MavenProject#clone() doubles active profiles
Description: "The error occured in our Project with more than 60 submodules and aggregating
  JavaDoc. Due to the forking of the LifeCycle many clones of the MavenProject object
  seem to be performed. Since MavenProject#clone doubles the entries in the list of
  active profiles we start with one active profile and after a few dozen clones the
  list of active profiles exceeds 10.000.000 elements. This will than kill the VM
  by OOME. \n\nmavenProject.getActiveProfiles().size() == 1 \nmavenProject.clone().getActiveProfiles().size()
  == 2 \nmavenProject.clone().clone().getActiveProfiles().size() == 4\nand so on "
