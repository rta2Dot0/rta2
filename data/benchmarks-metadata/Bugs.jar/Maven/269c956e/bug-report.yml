BugID: MNG-4474
Summary: "[regression] Wagon manager does not respect instantiation strategy of wagons"
Description: Calling {{WagonManager.getWagon()}} multiple times from the same thread
  (and with the same thread context class loader) will always return the same wagon
  instance, even if the wagon uses "per-lookup" instantiation.
