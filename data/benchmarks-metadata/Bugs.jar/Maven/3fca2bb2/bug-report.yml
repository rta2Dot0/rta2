BugID: MNG-4837
Summary: Interpolation error due to cyclic expression for one of the POM coordinates
  gets needlessly repeated
Description: |-
  This simple POM
  {code:xml}
  <project>
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <groupId>${groupId}</groupId>
    <artifactId>test</artifactId>
    <version>0.1</version>
    <packaging>jar</packaging>

        <url>file:///${basedir}/repo</url>
      </repository>

  </project>
  {code}
  causes the following model errors:

  [ERROR]     'groupId' with value '${groupId}' does not match a valid id pattern. @ line 25, column 12
  {noformat}
  Note the excessive repetition of the groupId related cycle although this expression actually appears only once in the POM.
