BugID: MNG-3131
Summary: Error message is misleading if a missing plugin parameter is of a type like
  List
Description: |-
  Here is a sample output I got when I was working on the changes-plugin:

  {code}
  [INFO] One or more required plugin parameters are invalid/missing for 'changes:announcement-mail'

  [0] inside the definition for plugin: 'maven-changes-plugin'specify the following:

  <configuration>
    ...
    <smtpHost>VALUE</smtpHost>
  </configuration>.

  [1] inside the definition for plugin: 'maven-changes-plugin'specify the following:

  <configuration>
    ...
    <toAddresses>VALUE</toAddresses>
  </configuration>.
  {code}

  Notice the second parameter toAdresses. It is of the type List, so the correct configuration would be something like this

  {code}
  <configuration>
    ...
    <toAddresses>
      <toAddress>VALUE</toAddress>
    </toAddresses>
  </configuration>.
  {code}

  I haven't found where in the code base the handling of List/Map/Array parameters is. That code could probably be borrowed/reused in maven-core/src/main/java/org/apache/maven/plugin/PluginParameterException.java which is the class responsible for formating the above messages.
