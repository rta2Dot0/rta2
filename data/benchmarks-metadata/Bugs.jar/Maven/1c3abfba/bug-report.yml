BugID: MNG-4915
Summary: Versions in pom.xml are not checked for invalid characters
Description: |+
  It seems that the pom.xml is not checking if the version contains invalid characters. If I have following fragment inside pom:

  <dependency>
    <groupId>junit</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
    <version>>>3.5</version>
  </dependency>

  then Maven is trying to download JUnit version >>3.5
