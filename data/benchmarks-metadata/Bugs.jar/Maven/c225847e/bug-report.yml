BugID: MNG-5459
Summary: failure to resolve pom artifact from snapshotVersion in maven-metadata.xml
Description: |-
  We're using Artifactory on the server side, and ivy / sbt to publish artifacts  upstream.

  After publishing several -SNAPSHOT versions of a project, trying to use it from Maven, resulted in a warning and ultimately a build failure because it cannot determine the dependencies:

  {code}[WARNING] The POM for com.foo:bar:jar:0.4.0-20130404.093655-3 is missing, no dependency information available{code}

  This is the corresponding maven-metadata-snapshots.xml:
  {code:xml}
  <metadata>
    <groupId>com.foo</groupId>
    <artifactId>bar</artifactId>
    <version>0.4.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <versioning>
      <snapshot>
        <timestamp>20130404.090532</timestamp>
        <buildNumber>2</buildNumber>
      </snapshot>
      <lastUpdated>20130404093657</lastUpdated>
      <snapshotVersions>
        <snapshotVersion>
          <extension>pom</extension>
          <value>0.4.0-20130404.090532-2</value>
          <updated>20130404090532</updated>
        </snapshotVersion>
        <snapshotVersion>
          <extension>jar</extension>
          <value>0.4.0-20130404.093655-3</value>
          <updated>20130404093655</updated>
        </snapshotVersion>
      </snapshotVersions>
    </versioning>
  </metadata>
  {code}

  As you can see, the <value> for the jar artifact and the pom artifact differ:

  0.4.0-20130404.093655-3
  0.4.0-20130404.090532-2

  Apparently, artifactory optimizes the case when an artifact doesn't change; it does not create a new file, but just links to the existing one.

  Maven, however, takes a shortcut and makes the erroneous assumption that the values for pom and jar artifact always match up.

  The attached patch fixes this.
