BugID: MNG-2221
Summary: Multiple Executions of Plugin at Difference Inhertiance levels causes plugin
  executions to run multiple times
Description: |-
  Can occur in a variety of ways, but the attached test case shows a parent pom defining an antrun-execution, and then a child specifying another execution with a different id.  Both executions run twice when running from the child.

  I believe this is the same as Kenney Westerhof's comment: http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MNG-2054#action_62477
