BugID: FLINK-3267
Summary: Disable reference tracking in Kryo fallback serializer
Description: |-
  Kryo runs extra logic to track and resolve repeated references to the same object (similar as JavaSerialization)

  We should disable reference tracking
    - reference tracking is costly
    - it is virtually always unnecessary in the datatypes used in Flink
    - most importantly, it is inconsistent with Flink's own serialization (which does not do reference tracking)
    - It may have problems if elements are read in a different order than they are written.
