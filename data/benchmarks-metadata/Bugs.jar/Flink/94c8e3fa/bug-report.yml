BugID: FLINK-1311
Summary: Auxiliary nodes in iterations are not correctly identified as "dynamic" or
  "static"
Description: The static/dynamic path tagger starts on the original roots of the step
  functions, ignoring possible auxiliary nodes that we need to attach to the root
  (such as NoOps, when the root is a union)
