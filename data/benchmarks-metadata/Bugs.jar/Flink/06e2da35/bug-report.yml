BugID: FLINK-2515
Summary: CheckpointCoordinator triggers checkpoints even if not all sources are running
  any more
Description: When some sources finish early, they will not emit checkpoint barriers
  any more. That means that pending checkpoint alignments will never be able to complete,
  locking the flow.
