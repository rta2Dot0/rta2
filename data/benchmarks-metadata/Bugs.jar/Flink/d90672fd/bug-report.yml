BugID: FLINK-3513
Summary: Fix interplay of automatic Operator UID and Changing name of WindowOperator
Description: |-
  WindowOperator can have a changing name because it has the TypeSerializer .toString() output in it's name. For some type serializers that don't implement toString() this means that the name changes.

  This means that savepoint restore does not work for the automatically generated UID.
