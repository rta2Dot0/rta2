BugID: FLINK-1686
Summary: Streaming iteration heads cannot be instantiated
Description: "It looks that streaming jobs with iterations and dop > 1 do not work
  currently. From what I see, when the TaskManager tries to instantiate a new RuntimeEnvironment
  for the iteration head tasks it fails since the following exception is being thrown:\n\njava.lang.Exception:
  Failed to deploy the task Map (2/8) - execution #0 to slot SimpleSlot (0)(1) - 0e39fcabcab3e8543cc2d8320f9de783
  - ALLOCATED/ALIVE: java.lang.Exception: Error setting up runtime environment: java.lang.RuntimeException:
  Could not register the given element, broker slot is already occupied.\n\tat org.apache.flink.runtime.execution.RuntimeEnvironment.<init>(RuntimeEnvironment.java:174)\n\tat

  org.apache.flink.streaming.api.streamvertex.StreamIterationHead.setInputsOutputs(StreamIterationHead.java:62)\n\nThe
  IterateTest passed since it is using a dop of 1 but for higher parallelism it fails.
  Also, the IterateExample fails as well if you try to run it. \n\nI will debug this
  once I find some time so any ideas of what could possible cause this are more than
  welcome. "
