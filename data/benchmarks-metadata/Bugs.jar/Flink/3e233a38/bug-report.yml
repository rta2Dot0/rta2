Summary: Set state checkpointer before default state for PartitionedStreamOperatorState
Description: |-
  Currently the default state is set before the passed StateCheckpointer instance for operator states.

  What currently happens because of this is that the default value is serialized with Java serialization and then deserialized on the opstate.value() call using the StateCheckpointer most likely causing a failure.

  This can be trivially fixed by swaping the order of the 2 calls.
