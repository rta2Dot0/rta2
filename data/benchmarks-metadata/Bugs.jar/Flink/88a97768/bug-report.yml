Summary: Watermark triggered operators cannot progress with cyclic flows
Description: |-
  The problem is that we can easily create a cyclic watermark (time) dependency in the stream graph which will result in a deadlock for watermark triggered operators such as  the `WindowOperator`.

  A solution to this could be to emit a Long.MAX_VALUE watermark from the iteration sources.
