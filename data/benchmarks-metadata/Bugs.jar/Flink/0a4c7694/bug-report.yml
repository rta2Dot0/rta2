BugID: FLINK-1496
Summary: Events at unitialized input channels are lost
Description: If a program sends an event backwards to the producer task, it might
  happen that some of it input channels have not been initialized yet (UnknownInputChannel).
  In that case, the events are lost and will never be received at the producer.
