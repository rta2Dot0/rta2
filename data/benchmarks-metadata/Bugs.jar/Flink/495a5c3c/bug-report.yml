Summary: Streaming does not correctly forward ExecutionConfig to runtime
Description: |-
  When running streaming jobs you see this log entry:
  "Environment did not contain an ExecutionConfig - using a default config."

  Some parts of the code use an ExecutionConfig at runtime. This will be a default config without registered serializers and other user settings.
