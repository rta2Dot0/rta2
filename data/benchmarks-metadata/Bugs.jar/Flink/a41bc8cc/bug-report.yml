Summary: TypeExtractor.analyzePojo has some problems around the default constructor
  detection
Description: |+
  If a class does have a default constructor, but the user forgot to make it public, then TypeExtractor.analyzePojo still thinks everything is OK, so it creates a PojoTypeInfo. Then PojoSerializer.createInstance blows up.

  Furthermore, a "return null" seems to be missing from the then case of the if after catching the NoSuchMethodException which would also cause a headache for PojoSerializer.

  An additional minor issue is that the word "class" is printed twice in several places, because class.toString also prepends it to the class name.
