Summary: Session Window State is Not Checkpointed
Description: |-
  The merging window state in the {{WindowOperator}} is not checkpointed. This means that programs containing session windows will fail upon restore after a failure.

  I propose adding a simulated snapshot/restore cycle to the tests in {{WindowOperatorTest}} to catch these problems in the future.
