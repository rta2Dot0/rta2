BugID: FLINK-3107
Summary: ZooKeeperCheckpointIDCounter.start() can block JobManager actor
Description: |-
  In HA mode, the job manager enables checkpoints during submission of streaming programs.

  This leads to call to ZooKeeperCheckpointIDCounter.start(), which communicates with ZooKeeper. This can block the job manager actor.

  A solution is to start the counter later instead of the CheckpointCoordinator constructor.
