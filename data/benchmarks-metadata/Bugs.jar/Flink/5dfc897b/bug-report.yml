Summary: FileMonitoring function throws NPE when location is empty
Description: |-
  {{StreamExecutionEnvironment.readFileStream()}} does not handle a missing location properly. I would suggest to log that the location is empty and continue running the job.

  A test covering the correct behavior is also needed.
