BugID: FLINK-1820
Summary: Bug in DoubleParser and FloatParser - empty String is not casted to 0
Description: "Hi,\n\nI found the bug, when I wanted to read a csv file, which had
  a line like:\n\"||\\n\"\n\nIf I treat it as a Tuple2<Long,Long>, I get as expected
  a tuple (0L,0L).\n\nBut if I want to read it into a Double-Tuple or a Float-Tuple,
  I get the following error:\n\njava.lang.AssertionError: Test failed due to a org.apache.flink.api.common.io.ParseException:
  Line could not be parsed: '||'\nParserError NUMERIC_VALUE_FORMAT_ERROR \n\nThis
  error can be solved by adding an additional condition for empty strings in the FloatParser
  / DoubleParser.\n\nWe definitely need the CSVReader to be able to read \"empty values\".\n\nI
  can fix it like described if there are no better ideas :)\n"
