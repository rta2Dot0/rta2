Summary: Keyed State does not work with DOP=1
Description: |-
  When changing the DOP from 3 to 1 in StatefulOperatorTest.apiTest() the test fails. The reason seems to be that the element is not properly set when chaining is happening.

  Also, requiring this:
  {code}
  headContext.setNextInput(nextRecord);
  streamOperator.processElement(nextRecord);
  {code}

  to be called seems rather fragile. Why not set the element in {{processElement()}}. This would also make for cleaner encapsulation, since now all outside code must assume that operators have a {{StreamingRuntimeContext}} on which they set the next element.

  The state/keyed state machinery seems dangerously undertested.
