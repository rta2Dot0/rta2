Summary: Invalid execution graph cleanup for jobs with colocation groups
Description: |-
  Currently, upon restarting an execution graph, we clean-up the colocation constraints for each group present in an ExecutionJobVertex respectively.

  This can lead to invalid reconfiguration upon a restart or any other activity that relies on state cleanup of the execution graph. For example, upon restarting a DataStream job with iterations the following steps are executed:

  1) IterationSource colgroup constraints are reset
  2) IterationSource execution vertices reset and create new colocation constraints
  3) IterationSink colgroup constraints are reset
  4) IterationSink execution vertices reset and create different colocation constraints.

  This can be trivially fixed by reseting colocation groups independently from ExecutionJobVertices, thus, updating them once per reconfiguration.
