BugID: FLINK-1458
Summary: Interfaces and abstract classes are not valid types
Description: "I don't know whether this is by design or is a bug, but I am having
  trouble working with DataSet and traits in scala which is a major limitation.  A
  simple example is shown below.  \n\nCompile time warning is 'Type Main.SimpleTrait
  has no fields that are visible from Scala Type analysis. Falling back to Java Type
  Analysis...'\n\nRun time error is 'Interfaces and abstract classes are not valid
  types: interface Main$SimpleTrait'\n\nRegards, John\n\n\n val env = ExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment\n\n
  \ trait SimpleTrait {\n    def contains(x: String): Boolean\n  }\n\n  class SimpleClass
  extends SimpleTrait {\n    def contains(x: String) = true\n  }\n\n  val data: DataSet[Double]
  = env.fromElements(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0)\n\n  def f(data: DataSet[Double]): DataSet[SimpleTrait]
  = {\n\n    data.mapPartition(iterator => {\n      Iterator(new SimpleClass)\n    })\n
  \ }\n\n\n  val g = f(data)\n  g.print()\n\n\n  env.execute(\"Simple example\")"
